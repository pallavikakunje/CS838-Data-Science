Joining the vast selection of exceptional <---> iOS </---> puzzle gamesÂ is <+++> TwoDots </+++> [Free] the follow-up to <+++> Dots </+++> one of last years smartest and hugely addictive puzzle games. Â Similar to theÂ original title which has racked up over 20 million downloads the object of <+++> TwoDots </+++> is to connect dots of matching colors horizontally or vertically and also likeÂ its predecessor the best way to clear the level is to find squares of corresponding colors out of the game board in front of you. <---> The </---> game itself limits you to a specific number of moves in which you have to complete the challenges it sets for you. For example cleaning 50 red dots 50 blue dots and 50 yellow dots within 30 moves. <---> Each </---> of the short challenges are level-based so as you advance through it gets progressively tougher. However unfortunately players only get a fixed number of lives in this case a maximum of five which means any time you run out of moves before clearing the challenges you lose a life. <---> Should </---> this happen youâll instantly be prompted to purchase more moves for a grand $0. 99 cents. . but in a way this feels like a sneaky way of encouraging players to part with their cash. At one particular point even I was tempted but this would not have necessarily spelt victory for me so I therefore decided against it. <---> If </---> you quit a level youâll also lose a life so its not the most forgiving game if youâre stuck on a level and want to restart it. Sometimes itâs more a case of luck more than anything else since each of the dots are randomly generated and so thereâs no particular reason per-say why they couldnât have introduced a shuffle mode or similar. <---> The </---> 30 move challenges .
