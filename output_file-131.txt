A first glance at <+++> Imps in Tokyo </+++> [$1. 99] might not really reveal much about what type of game it is. A picturesque style and a dark purple-blue motif are at the forefront of information you can see from screenshots. Developer We are <---> Vigilantes </---> have crafted a game that is much greater than the sum of its parts. <+++> Imps in Tokyo </+++> is in broadest strokes a pattern recognition game. Passing most stages will require flying around dodging some enemies killing other enemies and collecting as many magic pellets as possible. <---> Simply </---> passing a stage will earn you a star but like many games achieving greater feats will grant you up to 2 more stars and a higher overall score for the stage. While this is very much an overused scoring system I don't really mind it. The gameplay is smooth the graphic and audio quality is top notch and the light-dark comedic vibe works for a pretty wide ranging audience. <---> The </---> nature of the game reminds of me of a bullet hell type shooter. Most instances wont have quite as many obstacles to dodge but you are going to need to navigate very tight space to earn all 3 stars in many stages. <---> At </---> first the controls felt a little on the sluggish side due to the follow distance your imp will trail your finger at but the first quick swipe to a side reveals a very satisfyingly responsive control scheme. Outside of the obligatory 'reverse the controls' insanely frustrating boss fight the only negative thing that I can say about it is that your own finger can obfuscate part of the screen from view at very inopportune times. There are also a few stages where you are in first person view shooting down enemies. <---> Controls </---> .
