Clutch Play is headed back to mobile with their sophomore title <+++> Skullduggery </+++> [$2. 99]. <---> No </---> bones about it this game is a head turner. You can find platformers of all shapes and sizes on <---> iOS </---> but this one is the head of its class. Just looking at the graphics(and my amazingly funny jokes) you can probably already guess there are plenty of head and brain puns to be found in this app. <---> What </---> you find underneath however is a really great game. In <+++> Skullduggery </+++> your objective is to collect taxes as a disembodied skull that can project itself at will who is trying to complete a series of levels and bosses. <---> You </---> do this by using the parietal bone (back plate bone of the skull) to pull back what looks like about half of the brain and letting go snapping the entire thing forward like a rubber band. Now I am pretty sure that normal brains aren't that stretchy or resilient but I haven't tested it myself so I can't really lodge an official complaint. <---> Its </---> a unique take on classic platforming that has a very cool <+++> Angry Birds </+++> [Free] style slingshot mechanic. Each time you draw back the bit of skull to launch yourself forward you go into a slowed down bullet time that gives you extra time to make precise shots. <---> As </---> you fling your way through the levels you will be given objectives that if attained will grant you stamps that unlock cosmetic upgrades. There are also secret areas that have small visual tells and contain treasure chests and artifacts that count towards the completion percentage that the game keeps track of. <---> The </---> screen real estate of the skull is pretty small. It doesn't really take up that much space. <---> What </---> .
