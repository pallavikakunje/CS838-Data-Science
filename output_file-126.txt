Nostalgia is definitely big business as the movie industry has known for decades and the game industry only just started catching on to. <---> It </---> a tricky thing nostalgia. Some people like to hand wave it away as though the positive feelings from a familiar situation are any less valid than the positive feelings from seeing a bit of visual spectacle. I strongly disagree with that notion. I think nostalgia is a wonderful thing and if a game can use it effectively the result is almost always a better all-around experience. <---> That </---> a big qualifier though. A game that relies solely on nostalgia is as empty as one that relies solely on graphical flair. <---> Nostalgia </---> only works for the audience that was there at the time. For everyone else you'd better make sure the rest of the game can support its own weight. <+++> DuckTales Remastered </+++> [$4. 99] casts its nostalgia net a little bit wider than most. <---> There </---> a genuine fondness among a very specific age group for the original series the game is based on of course. You could walk up to these people and say <+++> DuckTales </+++>! and count on them replying immediately with A-woo-woo! at a near one-hundred-percent rate. <---> The </---> show was only around for a short time in the grand scheme of things though so I'm not sure if that audience is terribly big. Certain elements like <---> Scrooge McDuck </---> and Donald nephews are a regular part of the wider <---> Disney </---> universe so that helps. There another audience they're playing to here however and it one of which I would count myself a part. I don't have any special fondness for the <+++> DuckTales </+++> animated series. I was always more of a <+++> Darkwing Duck </+++> kind of guy. If a rerun of <+++> DuckTales .
