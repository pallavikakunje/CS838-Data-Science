Not every game makes a good first impression. <---> As </---> gamers are human beings we tend to be comfortable with certain established ways of doing things and games that go too far outside the box in some way or another can be initially off-putting. Gamers are particularly sensitive when it comes to controls with good reason. A simple swap of the usual functions of buttons is enough to drive some people mad and I've seen people walk away from masterpieces like <+++> Shadow of the Colossus </+++> in the first five minutes because it played differently from how they'd like. Adding to the problem for <---> iOS </---> gamers is the sheer quantity of games available. Between new releases and sales it very easy to discard a game that doesn't feel good right away. <---> Well </---> <+++> Starborn Anarkist </+++> [$2. 99] does not make a very good first impression. Stepping into one of the more competitive genres on <---> iOS </---> its awkward physics-based controls and lack of guidance will probably have most people giving up on it after one play. This would be a mistake. <---> It </---> not easy to control at first and in some ways it never becomes easier but if you put in some time learning the physics and how to properly design your ship you'll find this game incredibly rewarding. There a bit of an art to playing this game well and that something that doesn't come along terribly often in this hobby. <---> In </---> this game you play as a garbage collector who has had enough. No wait you play as someone whose beautiful ship has been carelessly scratched while it was parked. <---> Actually </---> you play as a guy who really hates the color purple. Ah who knows. <---> You </---> see the story of the game is another way <+++> Starborn Anarkist .
