Aquiris Game Studio was on a mission with <+++> Horizon Chase </+++> [Free]. <---> They </---> wanted to recreate classic racing games like <+++> Outrun </+++> <+++> Top Gear </+++> <+++> Jaguar XJ220 </+++> and others from the late-1980s and early-1990s even getting the <+++> Top Gear </+++> composer Barry Leitch to create the soundtrack for the game. <---> And </---> oh did they knock it out of the park. They've created a game that spectacularly recreates the feel of the racing games of 25 years ago while abandoning the annoying aspects of those games creating this wonderful hybrid that shows that they managed to create their dream game. This is an arcade-style racing game with physics that aren't necessarily entirely unrealistic but definitely feature some canned responses to actions. <---> Hit </---> a wall and you'll spin out. Don't rear-end cars if you want to keep up your speed. You have several turbo boosts per race must manage fuel and can pick up tokens that help you unlock future levels. <---> The </---> feel of the cars the look of the game: it all manages to feel like something I'd have played when I was a kid on my <---> Genesis </---> but with a 3D low-poly style. <---> The </---> amount of content in this game is ridiculous. There nine or so tracks per country and an exceptional amount of variety in the courses. <---> The </---> progression barriers are such that you'll need to go back and do well on earlier tracks in order to advance further. Thankfully there are rewards for doing well â finishing third in the bonus races earns you a fleet upgrade and a new car for finishing first. <---> Get </---> a pro medal on each track in a country and you'll get a new car too. It could perhaps get a bit tedious over time but it .
