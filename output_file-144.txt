Certainly tower defense is a genre where it difficult to really rock the boat too much especially since the genre evolution was accelerated by the fact that it was a great fit for mobile and everyone and their mother decided to apply their take on the genre. <---> But </---> hey the games are still pretty fun and there still the occasional title with a clever twist on the proceedings. <+++> Crystal Siege </+++> [$2. 99] from Carrot Games and FDG Entertainment tries to apply an action-RPG take on tower defense without drifting too much into the <---> action-RPG </---> side of things like <+++> Dungeon Defenders </+++> [$2. 99] does. As such this winds up being a take on the genre that does some great things for itself while not rocking the boat too much. <---> The </---> game core tower defense is nothing too shocking: place towers at specific spots and as creeps come in range of them they take damage. The towers can all be upgraded and towers feature split upgrades at their third level with different effects. <---> As </---> well different enhancements can be bought for them in-game. But it the hero (sadly with only a male character option) who applies this game unique flourish. <---> The </---> hero can fly around the battlefield and use the mana that charged up to unleash powerful magic spells that can attack enemies trap them or protect the crystals that the enemies are trying to steal. This mana charges up over time but it also possible to go into combat mode to attack enemies directly though this all but stops mana generation so it best as a last resort. <---> Players </---> can buy items with the gold they earn for victory to buy weapons armor and rings that can affect attack stats magic and mana effectiveness and provide benefits .
