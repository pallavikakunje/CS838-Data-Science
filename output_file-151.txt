<+++> Drift'n'Drive </+++> [$2. 99] is quite the fun chaotic top-down racing game. I was intrigued by the game when I saw a GIF of it in action with a whopping 32-car field and it looked like something I had to play. And it lived up to my expectations. <---> It </---> very much an arcade-like experience. The cars auto-accelerate and have tires with low grip making them drift-happy and providing for a very chaotic game. <---> And </---> the only controls are left and right to steer with a turbo boost that charges up over time. Helping with the chaos is the fact that the courses are generated randomly in the career mode so it about reacting to what might be coming up next and trying to stay on the road. <---> Grass </---> and dirt slow the car down hitting trees and walls causes damage to the car and it possible to lose a wheel which makes steering more difficult until both front wheels are gone and the vehicle is just straight-up wrecked. I'm always annoyed when racing games make the player car start in last no matter what. <+++> Drift'n'Drive </+++> eschews this by making the starting position of the player car be whatever position they finished at in the last race. This means that some races are effectively impossible to win without advancing in them to start at a higher up position but it not necessarily the worst fate in the world either. <---> Because </---> tracks are randomized each time and there always monetary rewards for the stunts performed there plenty of reasons to keep coming back. Repetition is not always a bad word â in this game it cleverly integrated. <---> It </---> also means that failure is appropriately punished though crashes are especially punishing if starting near the front of the pack.
