Back in the day when our brains were just in their formative years and we didn't have a mobile touchscreen device to entertain us we could entertain ourselves with nothing but a pencil and a piece of paper from a notebook that should have been used for studying. <+++> Tic-Tac-Toe </+++> was the favorite in my circle of friends. <---> At </---> that age it didn't require a long setup for a single game like a round of <+++> Dots and Boxes </+++> or enough book smarts to make a big enough challenge for a game of <+++> Hangman </+++>. It was my first introduction to strategy games and a new turn-based puzzler has not only brought it back but they've found a unique way to make a deceptive and entertaining challenge. <+++> Tic-Tactics </+++> [Free] the latest from <---> Hidden Variable Studios </---> injects a big batch of anabolic steroids into the classic paper game by giving it a bigger playing field and a chance for strategy that looks simple but can be more complex than it appears. Just like the original <+++> Tic-Tac-Toe </+++> the goal is to get either three X or O in a row just like the typical nine-grid game but in this game there are nine grids on the board. <---> So </---> the true goal of the game is to win as many of the grids as possible. The strategy part comes in the brilliant way it expands on the game basic design. <---> This </---> simple twist on <+++> Tic-Tac-Toe </+++>is how it offers its unique chance for strategic gameplay. Every time you choose a square it requires you to think two steps ahead because you're not sure choosing to block or set yourself up for a win. You're also determining where your opponent will make his or her next .
