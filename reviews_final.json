If you get raided pretty hard, you get a free temporary shield to help you stabilize. I find this EXTREMELY good because in Boom Beach, there is no temporary attack protection.

It was a great and very popular game at the time. Then, this last summer (2016) I stopped playing after hitting Arena 6. I had no legendaries and thought of it as just a Supercell cash grab and you had to pay to win. At the time I think I had spent $10-20 on the game. Also there were very few updates. I also found it dull and boring. Then the game updates were frequent starting in about August and I went back on the game to see if it had improved with the 2 updates in July, and I was not disappointed. Since then I've actually began to play the game daily since then because of the updates that made the game better. Obviously the tournament idea was trash, but I still enjoyed it. The new cards every 2 weeks and new arenas made the game way better. It has improved a ton since the release/summer. They also made it so that legendaries are easier to get, like sometimes in the shop there will be a legendary chest that you can buy for 500 gems and because of those I now have 5/9 legendaries. Yeah, you'll have to maybe pay $5 for a legendary chest, but it's the easiest way to get it. However, you don't have to pay to play either because I have gotten 2 of those legendaries from a golden and free chest, so it is possible. Clash Royale was a 2 star game in summer, and now it's back to a 5. Good job Supercell.\n  ", "rating": "5 stars"}},

Your character is controlled for you, leaving only the \"shooting\" to your manipulation. The campaign, I found, was quite un-historically accurate, and lacking in depth. The weapons available were utter fantasy/fiction, and extremely difficult to obtain without purchasing with \"real\" money. The graphics were much worse (in my opinion, because of the idiotic outline of characters). And the gameplay itself wasn't entertaining.

I don't have the time or money to buy all the best guns and because of the last update it is no longer fun or fair.  Whether it is a bad connection to the server (which I didn't have an issue with before this update), glitching through stairs, or opponents having overpowered weapons and buffs, this game frustrates me every time I play!  Single player is not as bad but the story line is crap.  Also, single player is way to easy and when your \"brothers\" die in a mission they don't die all together, which contradicts to the plot at the beginning of the game. Guns are way too expensive and only people with good money to throw away seem to be good on multiplayer since the have so many buffs. This game used to be fun, but now it is boring on single player and annoying in multiplayer.  I understand that multiplayer is new and I think it will get better as the tweak it a little.  By the way, the whole energy system is dumb. They make you wait for it to refill before you can do more campaign and multiplayer.  They should get arid of it entirely.

Actually, with a little strategy you can beat it without spending a dime. For example, it makes absolutely no good to upgrade your HP to 1000 if one enemy's blow will cause 1001 in damage. So you're better off saving that money for your weapon or shield. Another tip is to use your upgrade points wisely. Adding a few points to your health or weapon does not help much, but adding it to your block will be much more beneficial. As you win more games, new amulets will be available and you should choose the endure amulet, which gives you back a fraction of your health after a fatal blow.

Then when you finally get past the hard characters, you start the next battle with little to no life. And if you don't have any life potions, you're pretty much stuck. And suppose you earn a thousand coins in a fight, and are trying to get a better weapon. In the first version of the game, you can go back and fight old characters and win the same amount of coins as you did in the first battle. Not so much in this version. A thousand coins earned in the first defeat gets you like 75 on the second.

Given that 2016 is even worse than this game, this franchise may be completely dead. I would like a refund or to have them fix some of these issues. Why is a 102 speed pitch twice as fast as an 85 mph pitch? The auto play is also very frustrating as I almost always seem to lose. The popup frequency is maddening and the bunting is often disastrous even with very high bunting skill. Compare that to stealing which seems much more fair. This game is really uneven. Also I seem unable to win even the simplest of leagues. As everyone else has said the base runners appear to be in slow motion while the fielders seem to move quickly.

Although I wish you guys can add a new idea in the game where we can attack our own base for practice purposes to identify strength and weak points. So that players can continuously adjust to fix their base into a good one. It'll also allow people to enjoy this idea because it's another way to expand the game and makes it more challenging because troops are being deployed and will have to continue to refuel. But instead of using our own troops to attack our own base you guys can add a new thing as well which are called prisoners in war. Certain battles won will be given an amount of prisoners from that battle which can be use for practice purposes Since they are prisoners or be sold for food or gold or other purposes. You may ask why I may ask for these remarks but it's really something I've always wanted in games like DomiNation which is self attack for training purposes I don't know why but it always intrigue me. My imagination is pretty weird but I believe it will bring new interest, new challenges and will give DomiNation fans something to utilize on. I hope you guys can take this in consideration.", "rating": "5 stars"}},

The \"honest jobs\" was a nice touch, but even then can it take a very long while to accumulate more money.

He barley did any work it should take almost no energy. So get rid of that. And also I want more story than just a cut scene here and there. And my final complaint is how certain levels require certain guns or attachments so you have to go back and start all the way over but somehow keep the coins and do this multiple times to get the gun required. This is always a TERRIBLE way to make a game! Back tracking REPEATEDLY makes a game bland, repetitive, and seem like a ploy to get money!

This game would have definitely gotten a 5 Star had it not been for a couple minor tweaks. 1.) There are very limited weapon choices, it is possible for customization on the weapons and they work pretty well through the entire game. I'd just like to see more of a variety. And not just 3. 2.) You will almost be guaranteed to spend money on this game. To even do the Interrogation missions you must spend Red Crosshairs which are almost exclusively purchased with actual money. And to get your upgrades quicker it is a lot easier to drop $1.99 every so often to get a couple notches on the gun. Though these issues are mainly minor because almost all games come with some sort of way to get more money out of you. So this isn't a huge issue. I see a lot of people complain about energy but it only takes 3mins to gain 1 energy back and you max out at 20/20 so it only takes an hour to get all of it back.

These pay to play games are like casinos.

You cannot purchase higher level tanks with game cash only gems and the gem to cash distribution ratio is 10,000 to 1.  I worked very hard to get one of the upper level tanks only to have the game come out with even higher tanks after my purchase.  The game cheats which forces you to use up the gems you earn so that you will have to buy more gems if you want to upgrade your tank.  The average out of pocket cost to upgrade to a higher level tank is around $600.  There are many more problems but too many to list.  One improvement which would remedy this is to either enable you to buy higher level tanks with game cash, or change the ratio of gem distribution and cheating, which would allow the players to buy higher level tanks in order to compete fairly...

Finally joined a legion and made some really good friends. Made it fun again...for a while. We worked together and built some really strong tanks. Now they are obsolete with the new Tier 6. A close friend was told by Chillingo no new tanks were coming and spend a large amount of gems on the supreme Tier 5 at the time. Two weeks later Tier 6 arrives. He wasted all his gems and a ton on upgrades again on an obsolete tank. Chillingo is money hungry. The matches are ridiculously one sided so you can never feel competitive. The Chinese players(although I despise racism) have a significant edge and favoritism abounds. There are Majors with Tier 6 tanks which is ridiculous. Tier 5 tanks were a 1 to 2 year goal. The lag has gotten a little better, unless you're fighting a Chinese team. The only reason I continue to play is for the friends I have made in our legion. The tank I am building now is obsolete. I know this, yet I refuse to spend a dime of real money to speed the purchase of a tier 6 tank. I will play. I will not spend money. I will enjoy my friends.

The leaders all use crystals and set the bar so high that the only way to achieve any results is to do the same.  Cash grab, cash grab, cash grab.... they lure you in with early success and once you are invested the never ending updates will leave you taking one step forward and two steps back.

For example, if I was playing as Pascal from Tangled, in the background there could be like a flute or piano playing \"I See The Light\" or \"When Will My Life Begin\".

The game is a great recreation of Crossy Road with a Disney theme.  If you are unfamiliar with Crossy Road think of Frogger. There are two major issues.  The first deals with their ads.  The app didn't originally have ads and for a game designed to only take a couple of minutes to play at most it is hard to stomach being forced to watch a 30 second ad to make a 60 second run through the game.  They used to let you skip ads after 5 seconds or so when they first added them, but now you have to watch full 30 second ads.  And they are all the same Disney ads.  Over.  And over.  And over.  You cannot remove them even if you make a purchase.  The other issue is they used to allow purchases but you could unlock almost everything through the game.  Now there are limited time items/costumes/Characters that have to be purchased.  If we have to purchase them... and I get that with the app needing to raise revenue... then purchasable items should not be forced on the public in limited time.  \"Pay us $5.99 now or lose the ability to gain these characters forever.\"  Should not be part of this mentality.

Another thing that bothers me is the sliding zombies; there is a slight chance that a zombie will slide toward you when you shoot it. Also, the storyline ended way too quick.

The graphics are just as I remember on ps2, and some graphics in the game are even better! Controls are pretty good, seeing how u transferred the console controller to touch. Plus additional content I never experienced(Mostly cause I never had the Complete Saga just the separa1 and 2). This runs amazing on my iPad Air 2 and even my old iPad 3.

I rate the game based on script (how well it's programmed), graphics, sound, and creativity. I also may add innovative.

If I add up the score of the game based on all four categories and it is higher than one of the games already in the group then I delete the game and add the new one.

Single player has really good Ai so I recommend trying to kill them from long distance as well as on a more open map until you improve your aiming and get the controls down love team death match and goat game type the most the game is best played on Canal map it's more open and makes game easier. You earn new weapons by leveling up level up by playing and more features such as gun skins and more customization options! Good for playing with friends! allows you to invite friends from gamecenter who have the app to join your games i believe it might fix the problems with the slow multiplayer loading crossing fingers! And if you don't like this game I also recommend brothers in arms 2 it's more of a COD 2 feel and multiplayer loads quicker!

Most credit guns are between 700 and 1500 credits (7 to 15 dollars) and the credit guns need ammo that is purchased with credis.

I like the fact that you will slow down when coming into contact with the crab and duck but I think each level should contain a different character to slow you down. More sea creatures would give the game more variety, thus making it more pleasurable. The city around the slide should also include details like open windows, people in buildings, possibly some birds or planes, and lights that are turned off. Water slides that big should contain a bit more water. Levels could be added that contain splits and the choice would determine the outcome. When first seeing the main screen, you see the slide going all around the city. I believe showing the top of the slide may be better.

Anyway, I'm here to suggest my idea which is now more refined.  Clash of Clans has clan castles in which troops would flush out of once an enemy steps foot near the Perimeter. So I thought why not [Supercell] implement that in Boom Beach? The basis of it is that the \"Garrison\" is unlocked once your in a Task force, and you must be level [10-20?] to build it. The Garrison can harbor a squadron of troops [Roughly 9-10] or up to a platoon [16-40]. Fortunately for them, the player has to identify which are his own troops and which are the enemies. Of course they have different uniforms for that reason, but why not spice up the difficulty? The troops within the Garrison can be basic Riflemen or up to Grenadiers. The Garrison itself would be half the Health of headquarters. Barrages and Artillery could work on damaging the HQ, but however don't damage the troops inside. An alarm can sound once got alarm is tripped and depending on the defenders choice, silent or loud. The Garrisoned troops cannot trip mines and are immune to friendly fire. That rounds up my suggestion.\n  ", "rating": "3 stars"}},

However, if the game is supposed to be realistic, the shark shouldn't go about having to eat one or more persons a day. Shark attacks are rare and that should be made a point of. It is also unrealistic for a shark to be \"starving\" after just eating a ton of small fish, and quite annoying during gameplay, mind you.

To add insult to injury when I rejoin the track, I get a temporary speed reduction penalty because the game thinks I was trying to shortcut a corner.

If there was one, don't penalize the player with the temporary speed reduction penalty.

Once you have more cars this is less frustrating. In the end, for me, the fun of the game is outweighed by the aggressive ad insertion. The races are fast paced and varied. Without paying, it is difficult to get some of the vehicles, which require you to earn 10s or 100s of thousands of dollars. In a good match, you may earn 3-4k but on repeats you will earn far less, so acquiring new vehicles takes considerable time. Vehicle updates start cheap but are expensive at higher levels so you must balance out the desire to update a vehicle with the need to acquire new vehicles. Probably the most annoying feature is the constant freeze framing during races which causes you to wreck a lot because they will go to slo mo and when live action returns it is sometimes too late to correct your driving to stay on course. This also happens when you wreck, sometimes you are returned to the course in an untenable position causing you wreck again. By and large, it is a very fun game that is dragged down by excessive advertising. In my view the dune buggies are the most fun.

But, the game is seriously frustrating and I wish sports games would stop doing it.  As you progress ahead of the AI, the AI starts to \"cheat\" and make your player's stats worse.  It's basically a money grab.  Your players start dropping balls and start to get tackled easier.  It's very annoying when your WR drops the ball and gives the ball to the other team, it's like a handoff and is super stupid and unfair.  Imagine that you're posting up someone in basketball, you're in front of them.  Now pretend you're playing football and posting up somebody.  Someone passes you the ball, sometimes the defender you're backing down intercepts that ball over you in this game.

Specially when I play with Jafar who have like 620 point Value and I have blitz of +95% plus I buy the +10% power. The points I get doesn't make sense. Why is it so low even with all those high point value and additional points that should've been added? There more ridiculously aggravating things I noticed in this game but I don't want to make this review too long. I hope you guys actually read this and hopefully fix it before you start losing players.\n  ", "rating": "3 stars"}},

Make it so you can upgrade your boat making it bigger, and paint your boat, and have different boat. designs. 4. Make it so you can see what fish you caught and kept in the mini tank on your boat.

I love working my way through tournaments and working to earn enough coins to buy new gear. If there's anything I would complain about it would be the play time. Each cast no matter how short or long the cast is it costs the same amount of energy. Energy that as far as I can tell does not increase with leveling up or refill through any other way than time or actual cash battery charges. I understand the company needs to make money and I understand the concept of limiting playtime to increase desire to play. But playtime is so short it just leaves you frustrated. And as far as the energy for cash scenario I would be far more likely to spend more money on a permanent energy upgrade than less money on temporary boosts. Plus would it kill you to refill the energy with each level up?! That is beyond frustrating! \"Ohh new gear is available but I can't use it cause I'm out of energy.\" Either put in a way to permanently increase energy or add a zen fishing section where you don't spend energy but you also don't earn anything.

The battles should be pair up equally, you shouldn't be in a battle against other tanks that are 3 & 4 ranks above your tank.

The programers have developed this game to cheat in order to manipulate the results of the battle.  After playing this game for over a year I have almost completely stopped putting any money into the game.  Some problems are as follows.  You cannot purchase higher level tanks with game cash only gems and the gem to cash distribution ratio is 10,000 to 1.  I worked very hard to get one of the upper level tanks only to have the game come out with even higher tanks after my purchase.  The game cheats which forces you to use up the gems you earn so that you will have to buy more gems if you want to upgrade your tank.  The average out of pocket cost to upgrade to a higher level tank is around $600.  There are many more problems but too many to list.  One improvement which would remedy this is to either enable you to buy higher level tanks with game cash, or change the ratio of gem distribution and cheating, which would allow the players to buy higher level tanks in order to compete fairly...

Finally joined a legion and made some really good friends. Made it fun again...for a while. We worked together and built some really strong tanks. Now they are obsolete with the new Tier 6. A close friend was told by Chillingo no new tanks were coming and spend a large amount of gems on the supreme Tier 5 at the time. Two weeks later Tier 6 arrives. He wasted all his gems and a ton on upgrades again on an obsolete tank. Chillingo is money hungry. The matches are ridiculously one sided so you can never feel competitive. The Chinese players(although I despise racism) have a significant edge and favoritism abounds. There are Majors with Tier 6 tanks which is ridiculous. Tier 5 tanks were a 1 to 2 year goal. The lag has gotten a little better, unless you're fighting a Chinese team. The only reason I continue to play is for the friends I have made in our legion. The tank I am building now is obsolete. I know this, yet I refuse to spend a dime of real money to speed the purchase of a tier 6 tank. I will play. I will not spend money. I will enjoy my friends.

As another reviewer suggested, perhaps there could be an option to \"hide\" levels that aren't being used. I also deducted 1 star because this is the only game in which one has to wait an entire hour for 1 life to replenish. It doesn't allow for much time to be spent playing the game. There should at least be an option to buy a decrease in the time with coins. For example, 200 coins for a 15 minute reduction. I'd also like to be able to use the \"infinity\" lives separately. I won two 2 hour unlimited lives, but I wasn't able to use them separately. So I essentially won 4 hours of unlimited lives- and I was only able to use 15 minutes or so. It'd be nice to be able to start the unlimited lives at the player's convenience- when they actually have some spare time to use the prize. I've seen the same complaints / suggestion several times, over and over for quite some time, yet the developers have not given these any attention. I'd probably give more stars if the developers actually made some changes based on these suggestions.\n  ", "rating": "3 stars"}},

All my friends have like a high score of like two hundred! Most if my friends only have a high score of hundred and some have like five hundred. My point is just that i think you should get this game. Only because I think a game thus good should have way more viewers. I'm not trying to say this is the best game ever but it's like the second best game ever. It might seem hard at first but when you start playing it more you get higher scores. Also the bird colors are really pretty, just like the background as rainbows.

Maybe not like the actual music, but like a flute or something playing the tune to some of the songs from that movie when you're playing a character from that movie. For example, if I was playing as Pascal from Tangled, in the background there could be like a flute or piano playing \"I See The Light\" or \"When Will My Life Begin\".

The game is a great recreation of Crossy Road with a Disney theme.  If you are unfamiliar with Crossy Road think of Frogger. There are two major issues.  The first deals with their ads.  The app didn't originally have ads and for a game designed to only take a couple of minutes to play at most it is hard to stomach being forced to watch a 30 second ad to make a 60 second run through the game.  They used to let you skip ads after 5 seconds or so when they first added them, but now you have to watch full 30 second ads.  And they are all the same Disney ads.  Over.  And over.  And over.  You cannot remove them even if you make a purchase.  The other issue is they used to allow purchases but you could unlock almost everything through the game.  Now there are limited time items/costumes/Characters that have to be purchased.  If we have to purchase them... and I get that with the app needing to raise revenue... then purchasable items should not be forced on the public in limited time.  \"Pay us $5.99 now or lose the ability to gain these characters forever.\"  Should not be part of this mentality. The game is great,  but they need to rethink their revenue streams and make them sensible but not so annoying.  They just might make us quit playing.\n  ", "rating": "3 stars"}},

I also really like how you can press the button and all the stripes go one color and solids go another. This is nice when I'm not sure what balls I have left. I have a few suggestions. First I would like to be able to put spin on the cue ball. It would also be really cool if you could change the style of the cue sticks. Also sometimes the computer misses some really obvious and easy shots and just butchers them. Then sometimes it make 5 crazy hard shots in a row.  If you could balance this that would be great. Also maybe make it so there is only one power bar and shoot button. I realize that this is helpful for left handed people but maybe there could be a setting where it swaps the side instead of having to have two all the time. I keep accidentally shooting when making micro adjustments. It would also be cool if you could change how much of the guide there was, during the game. For instance if you were playing and you could press a button and the guide would only show you where the cue ball was going and what it was going to hit, but it didn't show you how it was going to ricochet. Then you could also have it so it didn't even show you where he cue ball was going, but it still showed which way the stick was pointing. Then also where the guide when farther then normal, and the highest mode where the guide showed where everything was going to ricochet and where it was going and how far.

The update ruined the game cosmetically. The new features is glitchy and choppy. The worst part is the graphics are choppy for the racing. I'm not too fond of the lighting change on the cars either. Also, the scamming problem seems to have worsen. After all this time, it hasn't been dealt with properly and causes players to lose cars and perpetrators to go unpunished. Another issue, the reduced time of part installation. Previously, it was watch the video and 'X' out and reduce time. Simple as that. What I don't understand is why it's mandatory to install apps that we possibly don't want to reduce the time. This is just plain ridiculous especially for those with low GB storage iPhones. The game occasionally crashes and it's not as fluid as it was before. It's somewhat unplayable with these mechanics and update. I rather prefer having the previous version where it was fluid with less features rather than the current one which offers more features that are unnecessary and sacrifices performance. Im disappointed. Coming from the mouth of a veteran I'm ashamed to say it but this is my opinion. Hopefully, future updates will correct or improve the game. It was a great game that lost potential for the sake of updating.\n  ", "rating": "1 star"}},

Another thing is that on the watermelon mode, you don't hold down the stick. Instead, you tap it when you think it's right. That, I found, is a lot easier to do, especially with some of the really short distances. So I'd say, if you're going to play, go with the watermelon version! Much more enjoyable. And I think it offers a bit more challenge.\n  ", "rating": "4 stars"}},

Some of my scores have been much lower than those of friends who, as far as I can tell, could not possibly have solved the puzzle in fewer moves than I did. I would think that players who need fewer moves would be rated higher than those who need a lot of moves.

My biggest gripe, however, is the TWO prompts you're provided to share on FB the fact that you beat your friends -- including, specifically, at least one friend's actual name!

It is pretty addicting and to keep playing when energy runs out, unless you want to wait 5 hours to fill up again, you have to buy gems to keep playing. The problem is that the game is harder when using power ups and makes you burn through gems by say giving you 10 purple bubbles in a row, which has happened to me A LOT, when all you need is one orange to win. It reads your needs and doesn't give you what you need even with 25-30 bubbles left sometimes you won't get the bubble you need with say 2 colors left on the board.  Beware when using power ups, the algorithm changes and the bubbles you need become even less abundant when power ups are supposed to help, also because they cost gems most of the time to use thus the change in necessary bubble abundance. The other issue I have is perfectly aligned shots during pivotal moments to win or lose more often than not get hung up on another bubble that was close even though your shot was obviously lined up properly.

One time I had 50% territory and as I was expanding a bot spawned about two squared away from me and yeah... I got cut off. There should be a spawn algorithm that wouldn't allow bots to spawn a certain number of squares away from an enemy territory and other bots and the player. Either that or you could just simply give a 5 second invincibility to any bot/player who spawns.

So I replayed it a few times and used about half my energy majorly because I made mistakes but once the only thing in my scope was the red dot. No wind, not distance markers, no wind positive or negative wind markers just the dot. So I of course shot without them as it seemed they weren't needed. And then the bulletin curved showing the wind was implemented still, just the hud wasn't visible. So I retried and everything was there and I finished the level. But I've seen this and other minor bugs under somewhat similar circumstances such as bullet curve although I had the markers perfect or near perfect. It's possible the wind number showed 40 instead of -40 but that may have just been me misreading it.I'd like to see them fixed please.

However, if the game is supposed to be realistic, the shark shouldn't go about having to eat one or more persons a day. Shark attacks are rare and that should be made a point of. It is also unrealistic for a shark to be \"starving\" after just eating a ton of small fish, and quite annoying during gameplay, mind you.

I think that a limit on how many times you make a certain move should be taken into consideration such as in real chess (a max of 3 repeat moves before resulting in a draw).

It was fun at first, until I realized that the computer prevented me from making some very important moves. A knight once checkmated my king. I could have eliminated the king by using my pawn to kill the knight, but for some reason, it wouldn't let me. I didn't get it; it was a perfectly safe move that didn't expose the king to any more dangers and it was diagonal to the bottom of the knight. The computer was forcing my king to run. It wouldn't allow a different option that would tarnish the checkmate. Also, AI always keep making the same move until you move where they want you to. While I, as a human, cannot keep doing the same move, the computer is man-made and can keep doing the same thing over and over again. This is really bad as it molds the game into only how it can win. Players depend on better pieces to win since the computers have that advantage, yet, as you rank up, you lose that, making it near to impossible to achieve anything. It also glitches a lot mid-game. While this is a reasonably fun experience, it's also infuiriating. I recommend the developer to focus on fixing bugs and the AI before adding anything else.\n  ", "rating": "2 stars"}},

Coins are a hot commodity and you only get a lot if you bingo first or second. Sometimes third. And they want you spend the coins. But with 40 bingos in a single game, I've learned to not spend any after the first three bingos have been dealt out. Sure you don't get as many bingos but coins last a heck of a lot longer and are used more effectively. Also don't bother spending the 50 coins for the automatic bingo chip. I've accidentally done it and it's only proven worth it 1 time.  Overall it's a solid game and lot of fun.\n  ", "rating": "4 stars"}, "reviews_1": {"customer_review_title": "Game is fixed", "text": "\n    I would not recommend this game to anyone. It's fixed by the people who produced it & I have proven that - this is not just sour grapes, especially since I have not spent one dime on it. But that's why they fix it - to try to get suckers to spend $$$. Case in point - I have played NUMEROUS games where the SAME PERSON not only wins, but also places in FIVE OTHER POSITIONS for a total of six wins in a game that pays only once. This is for the real bingo game, not for that \"First Line\" game they have with two winners per game. However, should you choose to waste your time with this, follow some advice I gave for maybe.... MAYBE winning a game here & there. ", "rating": "1 star"}},

Please take this into consideration because I enjoyed this game immensely but I was disheartened seeing 1 game a day on other reviews, almost to the point I just simply considered uninstalling game to free up space for another game I could actually play more than 10 minutes a day. I cannot promise this will not be case in future, but I am hoping for the numerous similar reviews I have read and after writing this one that developers will consider the numerous mutual opinions of more than a single game a day on free version.\n  ", "rating": "3 stars"}},

For example, it will give you a seemingly perfect arrangement of blocks for the board, only to trick you into boxing yourself in. This means you have to play the game a different way, and pay attention to open spaces. It's hard because the system works to make predictable moves that seem like the obvious choice backfire. Because of this, you have to skirt around predictability and strategize your moves past just the next block, like chess. You have to think ahead. I really enjoy this because it forces you into a whole new gameplay method, making it challenging but fun. That said, I rated it 4/5 stars because I do think an alternate mode for those who prefer the traditional gameplay experience would DRASTICALLY improve this app. It would please both people like me who enjoy the added challenge of a predictability-backfire based system and people who don't.

Also, I don't know if it's just me (admittedly, I'm not exactly technologically savvy) but I've been unable to get the multiplayer option to work. Aside from that, I enjoy the weapon selection, the depth of the levels, the zombie animations, the unreal engine, and the graphics. It would be nice if 2013 Infected Wars had enough updates and ambition for a continual series of apps that could give MFG's Dead Trigger series/ Unkilled a run for its money. Usually, there's something standing in the way of most mobile zombie shooters that prohibits them from being considered worthy of hours of continual gameplay, but this game fortunately hits the mark.

As stated, there are only two locations you can run in. There are so many more locations in the film that could have been used but go to waste. That and the only true objective is upgrading your stats, which makes for dull gameplay that is vulnerable to getting deleted off one's home screen.

(i.e. Bones could spawn a friendly skeleton, uther could charge forward and destroy things in his path, etc.). Maybe after three stars you could unlock it with tokens or something.

The life bar at the top is another thing that needs to go. Part of the fear factor in playing this is in not knowing when or if slenderman would get you. The depletion of the bar is a giveaway that your about to die and coupled with the fact that slenderman makes you look at him, its also cheap. Keep the face cam and everyplay record and share features however. Its cool to be able to let others see your replays. The new levels are good add ons as well.

The ads aren't even that intrusive to the gameplay. It's not like they'll make you stop in the middle of a level to watch an ad, and most of the ads can be skipped. I do think that they could tone it down a bit though. Because most of the zones in Sonic CD can be rushed through fairly quickly, you may end up getting an ad every minute if you are fast enough. Rather than have an ad show up every time you complete a zone without exception, it may have been a better idea to give the ads a 5 minute timer, and when that timer is done, it will show you an ad the next time you either pause the game or finish a zone. Even still, I don't see why so many people are complaining about the ads, since the only people who would find these ads to be such a huge problem that they would rate the game with only one star are probably not the type of people that are absolute speed demons at the game anyways. If you're trying to get all of the good futures, then the ads become even less of a problem since you'll most likely be finding yourself spending a few minutes in each zone in that case.

It feels different, jumps different, and acts different. That being said, it is very playable, just not as much so as Flappy Bird. To all the people whining that they find this offensive: grow up. This is satire. Don't be childish, if these people don't agree with the views of a politician, it is their Constitutional right to mock him. For everyone criticizing these people: your reviews are just as useless as theirs. They take up space and distract people from the point of a review, which is to learn about an app. Now, back to the game itself. Graphics, poor, differently styled from Flappy Bird. The feel gets repetitive quickly, and I deleted the game after about three days. I did not find this game to be, in any way, fun. It is also not a good Flappy Bird substitute. The only way I can picture someone owning this app for over a week is if they are trying to make a political statement. Other than that, a waste of space, unless you really do enjoy this games type of humor. Even Trump opposers, I assume, will delete this game quickly, as it is, simply put, lacking in nearly every regard. The bottom line: despite any views you have, give it a try. It's a small download and free, and there is absolutely no commitment if you change your mind, like me. Enjoy!\n  ", "rating": "2 stars"}},

The older generation of phones might not work(iphone4) because they're too small, sorry older generation. My idea for the app would have a small light directly under the radiation counter illuminate to illuminate the radiation counter, to give it the illusion that it was working. This light could be toggled on and off from the settings menu. My foam cut out for my Iphone 6 was cut in a way so that, the phone on its back with the home button facing the radiation counter, the screne is able to reach the radiation counter to be able to illuminate it.

For melee I found it easiest to hit once or twice, then dodge with the left and right arrows, and repeat cause the zombie will be able to reach you if you just keep trying to wack it or push it and not dodge.

Well maybe some reviews but still. We all know the thing I'm about to list has been requested so many times that it's needed to be added, Multiplayer. Yes multiplayer. It's so boring having to keep playing the same game over and over again in single player. Yes you can show off worlds but that doesn't help at all. It seems you've been avoiding multiplayer like it would ruin your whole reputation or something. But it's desperately needed in this game. Now i just wanna say, you probably will never read our requests but at least read a few! Now that's not all, guns. Guns. Guns are probably the most useful item in this game I get the game is for younger age groups but it will help hunting down dangerous encounters. Or food. Now boats. Boats, not the small ones the big ones. You know the ship that drops you off onto the island.. any who that's probably it.

Definitely worth it's price in my book, so I gave it 2 stars, but the block variety and graphics and the monsters really make the app less fun, though the app DOES only make a dollar with each purchase, so the progress this app has made is definitely pretty good based on their more limited cash, unlike those other apps that have who knows how much to spend and NEVER update.

And when your done riding in it, them jump and you can walk again. Another cool improvement is if you can fly, cause in this game you can't jump that high. Another good improvement would be changing the color of the red animals skin. Because the rest of the animals skin color you can change, but not the red ones. And the last cool thing that would be fun to have on this game is fake people or real people. Like if someone else happens to be playing in the same world as you, then you should be able to see them and chat with them.

Try to make it seem less minecraft knock off-y and make it like an actual game. Number 2: This game seriously needs to be debugged. Now I don't know if it's just me experiencing these problems but I'm gonna say them. One major glitch a came across about a year ago was that you couldn't search any world and after that bug was fixed, I think every world before that bug just died, except for the featured worlds. Now, there is one big I'm currently experiencing. Whenever I name and upload a world, it's name doesn't change. You need to fix this bug right now because it's making a lot of worlds lost in the abyss of being named World 6 or World 372. That's all I have to say about this game. It's a really good game for a knock off. It does have problems but they can be easily exterminated if you look at this game as a game. That's all I have to say.

He also turns INTO Shade when he uses his power? He should just be a shadow version of himself, not of the person he took the powers from, right? Anyway... I think you should also add Tox and Camille into the bosses. Possibly Skylar, too. They are far more important than Ronin ever was in the 4th season.

The first thing is, not being able to steal certain vehicles, until a certain level. That is completely ridiculous and takes out the fun of freedom. The second thing is, the energy system. You have to have energy to do missions. When you run out of energy, you have to wait for more. This can become very annoying, if you want to keep doing missions over, and over again, like me. Now, the third thing kind of goes along with the second thing, and that is the repetitive missions. I can't tell you how many times I've played the same mission. Heck, sometimes my mission doesn't even work, because it glitches out. I've put in a lot of time in this game, so I could get a high level, and unlock better vehicles as gear. However, I am currently level thirty-two, and I've gone at least 6 times, without earning anything for levelling up. I'm just really anxious to unlock the helicopter.

It's fun pushing the limit to see how far you can get before you prestige. Each time you prestige, you get X amount of relics. The amount of relics you earn is based off of your characters level, your group level, and the stage in the game you reach. You use the relics to buy artifacts which give you a variety of bonuses such as additional damage, or more dropped gold while playing. It's a pretty fun game, but can get boring. When it gets boring for me, I just let my characters grind for me offline, and when I open the game again, level them up, advance to a stage proportionate to my team's strength, and close the game. So either way you want to play, I think it's fun. I did buy the lowest possible amount of diamonds to get rid of the ads, so it makes the game a little more bearable. One final bit, I would not recommend spending diamonds on anything except buying things for your character, and there's no need to actually spend cash for diamonds. You get plenty of free ones in game through drops, events, ads, and weekly login awards.\n  ", "rating": "4 stars"}},

I'm not in hard mode so I don't understand what most people are talking about so I may have more complaints in the future. Second this is really my fault but I just want to say that before this update I was doing really well and I watched this video and apparently I had the one of the best pre-hardmode sword it shot beams out I'm mad because when the game updated I lost my worlds and my characters but I didn't understand cloud save but now I'm doing really good better than before but I don't have that sword I just can't find it. Great game overall and nothing like Minecraft people just say that because they both have blocks I hate when people say it's like Minecraft. I don't understand how to get a platinum coin I think that's what's it's called because I want to get the pet old lady but I've never seen a platinum coin I have platinum ore and bar but no platinum coin.

Accessoires,when I wear accessories like the lightning boots they always make my outfit and or armor look funny it would be great if they added a setting so you can make it show or make it go away. Ok 2. Wings, I know terraria probably gets this a lot but is making more wings possible? I would like it if you could dye wings and sorts of things like that would be cool. 3. Goblin guy, I don't know his name but the goblin that can combine things and enchant them(on PS4,Xbox,etc.) I can't enchant anything with the goblin I'd like it if that was made possible so I can get better armor weapons and accessories. And last 4. This is the important one, purification power. Now thank god for this item to make the cursed biome (purple biome) or the currupt (red biome) to purify and be gone (or so I thought) I bought about 4 stacks of 99 of it from the dryad and used it all on my corruption biome. within 2 terraria days all of the power I used dissolved and the corruption was even worse I don't want to live in a corruption biome so please make the purification powder more effective or please make the evil biomes not spread so much. (I would prefer both if possible) so yeah that's all the stuff I have to say but besides all of that this game is by far one of the best games I've ever played so keep up the good work \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\n  ", "rating": "4 stars"}},

The game has a variety of guns, and skill does come into play, by skill I refer to experience in shooters. The controls are hard to get accustomed with, but after some training you will get the trick. I have had this game for less than 24 hours as of now but I already hit level 8, you need to be level 6 for multiplayer tho. So it isn't right from the beginning multiplayer. But the store system here is similar to CS:GO's crate system. But here you buy a crate and it opens. The crates are fairly priced. They also have special edition crates, some are time limited and others have higher powered weapons. You also have gear ratings, the gear has it own crates and it has perks to it. The game is a fantastic past time or if you are in the mode for shooting and don't have the money to get a new game for your PC or console then this will do. Now I would advise that you do as I did, put 5 dollars into the game, you should be able to buy at least 1 special time limited crate, they also go on sale with fantastic sale prices. I hope you give this game a try it is truly amazing.\n  ", "rating": "5 stars"}},

The amount of customization in the squads and equipment they can use is overwhelming at first, but rewards anyone willing to take the time to read and equip them. The ridiculous  amount of units you can choose from keeps the game interesting. The amount of viable units rivals Pok\u00e9mon in their diversity and uniqueness. Because you might have a squad that you really like and then you see another unit that another player has and you go \"ooooo how do I get that one?!\" This along with dungeons that open up on certain days keeps the game from getting too monotonous and repetitive. The evolution system should be somewhat familiar to anyone who's played Pok\u00e9mon, only some of the rarer units have 6 or more evolutions before they max out, so it'll be awhile before you truly max them out. The main campaign gets a bit boring after awhile, but the different units you encounter in each new region as well as unique boss units keep you coming back because almost any of them are up for possible capture, even some of the bosses. So if your looking for a game that is very fun but not horribly confusing or overly complex, with units that give you more customization than most games and rivials the customization of Pok\u00e9mon in terms of units to choose from, this is the game for you.

Also making it a little easier for villagers to level up in what they are doing like mining or forestry would be great. They're old and moving on or dying before you can get them even halfway to becoming a master villager. Just my thought.

Ditto to numerous positive feedback already given. I do want to address the complaint that the game is too difficult, meant to force you to spend money. Actually, with a little strategy you can beat it without spending a dime. For example, it makes absolutely no good to upgrade your HP to 1000 if one enemy's blow will cause 1001 in damage. So you're better off saving that money for your weapon or shield. Another tip is to use your upgrade points wisely. Adding a few points to your health or weapon does not help much, but adding it to your block will be much more beneficial. As you win more games, new amulets will be available and you should choose the endure amulet, which gives you back a fraction of your health after a fatal blow.

Then when you finally get past the hard characters, you start the next battle with little to no life. And if you don't have any life potions, you're pretty much stuck. And suppose you earn a thousand coins in a fight, and are trying to get a better weapon. In the first version of the game, you can go back and fight old characters and win the same amount of coins as you did in the first battle. Not so much in this version. A thousand coins earned in the first defeat gets you like 75 on the second.

And my final complaint is how certain levels require certain guns or attachments so you have to go back and start all the way over but somehow keep the coins and do this multiple times to get the gun required. This is always a TERRIBLE way to make a game! Back tracking REPEATEDLY makes a game bland, repetitive, and seem like a ploy to get money!

This game would have definitely gotten a 5 Star had it not been for a couple minor tweaks. 1.) There are very limited weapon choices, it is possible for customization on the weapons and they work pretty well through the entire game. I'd just like to see more of a variety. And not just 3. 2.) You will almost be guaranteed to spend money on this game. To even do the Interrogation missions you must spend Red Crosshairs which are almost exclusively purchased with actual money. And to get your upgrades quicker it is a lot easier to drop $1.99 every so often to get a couple notches on the gun. Though these issues are mainly minor because almost all games come with some sort of way to get more money out of you. So this isn't a huge issue. I see a lot of people complain about energy but it only takes 3mins to gain 1 energy back and you max out at 20/20 so it only takes an hour to get all of it back.

One of the few games like it where one doesn't have to be a big spender to play. Highly recommend it for zombie themed FPS enthusiasts. While overall good gameplay, it's not without its flaws. Would give five star rating if not for one major glitch in the system. Something that could be fixed if one of two things were included in the update: The ability to interrupt the reloading process, or the option to disable said processe's automatic function. In the current version, reloading leaves player unfairly vulnerable to attack: Unable to switch weapons, or use items until the process is complete. Would be more efficient if player had the option to equip alternate weapon or utilize item instead of being forced to wait for current weapon to be reloaded once magazine is depleted. Being able to swap weapons or utilize items during automatic reload process would work as well. The trade-off of having to restart the entire automatic reload process when reequipping the weapon with the spent magazine would it be acceptable, as player would most likely be out of danger by then.

The only things I have a problem with are; when I use the grenade launcher, I see explosions in spots that I had shot earlier even if I didn't shoot there again. It doesn't really bother me that much during the game, it just gets annoying. Also, I don't like the reloading for some guns, mainly the shotguns. It just isn't right having to load four to six bullets into the gun after only shooting one. Also, the striker doesn't have a clip, it is basically a shotgun revolver and the drum isn't removable. Another thing that bothers me is the sliding zombies; there is a slight chance that a zombie will slide toward you when you shoot it. Also, the storyline ended way too quick. I think I remember something about an experimental weapon that the scientist was making. I don't remember if this was in there, but if it was, what is the experimental weapon? I really want to know.

But it's over 5 years old at this point and nothing has changed. Your accelerometer still gets out of sync with the game for some stupid reason, and now an ad gets shoved in your face on load up. And there aren't any more levels either. Supposedly things have been kept updated since I last played this app on a brand new iTouch 4, but it just seems like that's only been compatibility. That said, fix the accelerometer bug and it's worth 4 stars.\n  ", "rating": "2 stars"}, "reviews_1": {"customer_review_title": "The Slow Button Issue\u2122", "text": "\n    I used to have a 5s and  never had an issue with the Slow Button but I played the game for the first time on my 7 and I have to press a few times and press hard to get that button to work.

I really have fun with this game but I wish it it was a lot easier to earn weapons. For anyone who gets this game let me tell you a secret I found out, some weapons cost 200 some credits and you always start of with 3 and while I have not beat the game I'm pretty sure the game dosn't give u any :( however go to \"bank\" and you\"ll see something that says \" free credits\" and there is a camara in the background. When you click on it it says earn 1 free credit by watching this video. The video is a random commercial every time and when the video is finished and you continue you earn 1 free credit. And you can do that over and over again. Maybe this is how to offord those guns that cost credits. Though I hope not since that means you have to watch commercials 250 times. Sometimes it would say video not available but that only happenns when you are out of your signal range. I recommend this. Game to anybody. Get it now :)\n  ", "rating": "5 stars"}, "reviews_1": {"customer_review_title": "Greedy Glu", "text": "\n    I like this game, all in all it is fun and slightly addictive but there are some major problems. first of all is the fact that currency is so expencive. Most of the games weapons can be bought \"without\" dropping a few hundred bucks, but they are so expencive that the only way to get them without spending 24/7 on the game is to buy them with actual money. The problem is that you get verry little currency in transactions and you will  need to buy multiple currency packs to get any decent gun. there are also \"credits\" which are the premium currency, credits are used  to buy the best guns and ammo but they are expencive and the game is designed to keep you making IAPs for them. Most credit guns are between 700 and 1500 credits (7 to 15 dollars) and the credit guns need ammo that is purchased with credis. Also after a certain point missions start requiring weapons that are nearly impossible to get without paying 20+ dollars.   While you can get free credits, you have to watch an add and there is a 4 per day limit. The other problem is that the game is laggy and the guns are hard to use (the scope swaying is very annoying). I would have preferred that glu had made the game cost money outright and not had all these IAPs.\n  ", "rating": "3 stars"}},

You have 3 or 4 pop ups for installing new apps and making a purchase within the app. It makes you not even want to play the game at all. I don't like that you can't dismiss the tips on the left side bar...it doesn't stop blinking \"new\" until you purchase, cook and serve, or connect to Facebook like they're asking you to. I don't  like that you have to use 10 gems to change the name of your restaurant if you decide to. The profile avatar is very general and unpersonalized. The only way to expand is to get so many neighbors/friends and then you have to pay. You can only buy so many appliances at a time due to what level you're on regardless of how much money you have. When you leave the Restuarant at any time and return (regardless of how short the while).....all the food you've cooked for all those hours is gone, and sometimes the money you get doesn't always add up. Some of the decorating designs shouldn't cost any gems like a tile or wall paint, but should be able to be purchased with coins.

Issues continue to plague the game. \"Processing\" freezes play, videos to earn gems won't load after the first or second one has played, sometimes after hours away my counters don't empty while I've been cooking new foods, requiring me to add counters and sometimes food is gone so fast I question amounts I had out. The incessant ads for their other TL games which pop up and also dot the playing field are a nuisance. I know you want to push your other games, but this is excessive! The repetitive taps to cook and serve the food are unnecessary since you can purchase appliances that don't require so many. It would be nice, for a small one time fee if necessary, if you had that option or all your appliances. These problems are finally causing me to rethink my commitment to play as this game takes a lot of time to be played as intended and it seems TL doesn't read reviews or care about ongoing problems that continue to occur. They do affect the players ability to enjoy the game and stick with it, attract new players and causes your overall reviews to be less gracious than they should be.

The only reason I started playing this? They stopped making updates to Tiny Chef and it's pretty much unplayable now. I still prefer Tiny Chef but I have no choice but to play this in its place. I HATE what is essentially \"spam pop ups\" and the \"spam goals.\" What is this spam I'm talking about? The glorified ads for other Team Lava games! No, I DON'T want to install ANY of your other games, quit asking me as soon as I open the app! But somehow, I find the \"spam goals\" even worse than the pop up ad you get every time you open the game. Why? There's no point to completing them! Why don't we get rewards?! Why can't you decline them? Why are they always at the top of the list so I have to often scroll down just to see me real goals that actually do give me rewards, it's ridiculous! If you want us to download your other games and put them as GOALS in this game, why don't you actually put uhh, REWARDS for clearing the \"spam goals.\" This is why I preferred Tiny Chef, Tiny Chef never did this.
