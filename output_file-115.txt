<+++> Kindo </+++> [$1. 99] is the kind of game I feel somewhat conflicted about. <---> It </---> a game that I like and respect. I appreciate it for what it is and everything that it does. I think the concept of the game is strong easy enough to pick up on while allowing for high level play. <---> It </---> does almost everything it needs to in terms of features. But it the kind of game that I personally won't be playing long-term because it doesn't give me the kind of satisfaction I like from games. <---> The </---> goal of <+++> Kindo </+++> is to conquer your opponent kingdom square in the opposite corner of a 5x5 grid. You get to make 2 moves per turn and can either lay down a new square or fortify an existing square. <---> Fortification </---> makes it impossible to capture that square from the foritifed direction. You can get up to 2 extra moves per turn by either cutting off opponent squares from any other connecting squares or by having an opponent capture a square that you have just played. <---> So </---> if you're smart and can force your opponent into the plays you want you can take advantage of them. And since the game board is so small getting a 4-move turn is often a back-breaker. <+++> Kindo </+++> is definitely a game where you have to be careful and deliberate. <---> Against </---> novice players your mistakes may go unpunished. But against high-level players I found that if I left one key opening I'd often get punished right away. I started to detect these mistakes shortly after I sent the moves which caused many profanities to be uttered to myself over how stupid I was. Thankfully most of my high-level matches (from veterans of the betas) were friendly matches via .
