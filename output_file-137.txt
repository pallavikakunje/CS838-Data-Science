Stealth is one genre that still isn't oversaturated at least in my own mind. <---> While </---> there have been plenty of stealthÂ games as far back as the NES era pretty much every title adds in their own signature spin to the formula. <+++> Sneaky Sneaky </+++> [$2. 99] is no different featuring a tiny little rogue with an adorable pet rat. <---> Starting </---> off like <+++> The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past </+++> our hero is stuck in a jail cell after he was robbed of all of his riches. Not to worry though as the title character is pretty resourceful. <---> The </---> setup is immediately both adorable and eye-catching as the bright hues work wonderfully with the general dark theme of the game. Even if it an arid desert or dank dungeonÂ  <+++> Sneaky Sneaky </+++> is full of life. <---> Your </---> endgame is to get your rubies back through a series of levels which take place in a grid-like fashion with patrolling enemies at every turn. Think <+++> Metal Gear Solid </+++> where stealth is the name of the game until you're spotted and then everything takes a turn for the worse. <---> Of </---> course due to the grid mechanic tapping is a perfect control scheme. All you have to do is direct your character around to any square you want and you're either jumping into a hidden object like a haystack grabbing a piece of treasure or taking down am unsuspecting guard. <---> Â If </---> you're seen the entire game changes into a turn-based affair and you simply can't sprint for the exit -- you have to make your next few moves count. I love the dichotomy between the two action and strategy based styles as it gives the game two distinct feels to it. <---> Stealth </---> combat with both backstabbing and bow-use work .
