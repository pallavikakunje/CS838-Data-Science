When I sat down to try <+++> Motorsport Manager </+++> [Free] I thought it would be the perfect thing to poke at while listening to a podcast. After all I wouldnât be expected to drive the cars; Iâd be running the biz and laying out the race strategy. A half-hour in I realized I hadnât absorbed a word because I was so fully engaged in growing my fledgeling racing empire and watching my drivers tear up the track. Itâs never overwhelming nor is it too light to maintain interest. <+++> Motorsport Manager </+++> finds a nice spot in the complexity spectrum wherein it requires frequent decision-making without ever inducing paralysis by presenting too many options simultaneously. <+++> Motorsport Manager </+++> makes an immediately striking impression with a stylish color palette and a nifty tiltâshift camera effect replete with chromatic aberration.

The second phase is setting qualifying times for races to determine racer positions. A simple matrix of gearing aerodynamic and tire options creates a variety of configurations and a little intuition and experimentation is required to achieve the best standing. If that sounds a little boring or fiddly there .
