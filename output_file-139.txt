Of all of the <+++> Ultima </+++> games you would expect someone to want to make a tribute to <+++> Ultima 2 </+++> has got to be near the bottom of the list. <---> Oh </---> it no <+++> Ultima 9 </+++> to be sure but I've always seen it as the little road bump on the way to <+++> Ultima 3 </+++> and 4 more fully realizing the concept of the series. It a familiar story for sequels I suppose but by playing things a bit too safely it had to succeed without the novelty of the original game and all of its faults. It was still a pretty good game in its time but relative to the series on the whole I think it kind of underwhelming. I'm sure a whole list of people might disagree with that and at least one of the names on the list would be the developer behind <+++> Lowlander </+++> [$1. 99]. <+++> Lowlander </+++> is an interesting case because it not often that a game paying direct homage to a classic is actually better than said classic. In this game you play as a humble adventurer who soon becomes a knight going on various quests issued to you by the king. <---> There </---> a big world to explore with lots of towns dungeons and loot scattered around. The gameplay is streamlined well enough that you can play with one hand but the game on the whole is complex enough to keep you engaged. <+++> Lowlander </+++> serves as something of a counterpart to last year enjoyable <+++> Vigil RPG </+++> [$0. 99] a game that cut away all the fat of exploration and focused on strategic battles with a variety of enemies. <---> Here </---> the combat is reduced to its bare minimum but the exploration .
