I hold two very strong opinions about the <+++> Dragon Quest </+++> series one of which is agreed upon by many and the other of which is slightly more controversial. First <+++> Dragon Quest </+++> is like pie in that there is no bad one. <---> My </---> least favorite is either <+++> Dragon Quest 2 </+++> [$4. 99] or <+++> Dragon Quest 8 </+++> [$19. 99] but I'd still hand over a weekend to replaying both no questions asked. With that being said the other thing that I believe is that the series hit its creative peak with <+++> Dragon Quest 5 </+++> [$14. 99]. That not to say subsequent games didn't sometimes hit some very high notes as my pie opinion shows. <---> But </---> if there is such thing as a work that a creative mind invests in so completely that they leave a big piece of themselves with said work forever <+++> Dragon Quest 5 </+++> would be a huge example. That an ominous way to begin a review of <+++> Dragon Quest 6 </+++> [$14. 99] I'll admit but I felt it was important to be upfront about that. Over the course of the series some patterns about the kinds of stories <+++> Dragon Quest </+++> tends to tell emerge. <---> Creator </---> and scenario writer Yuji Horii is a fan of bittersweet tales with <+++> Dragon Quest 5 </+++> perhaps being the ultimate one. <---> Typically </---> however those kinds of stories work best when they're short and as the series has progressed the games have become increasingly focused on these little vignettes to the point that they're generally more interesting than the main plot. <+++> Dragon Quest 6 </+++> is where the balance officially tipped in favor of those mini-stories I think. <---> The </---> other thing the series is concerned with is the nature of .
