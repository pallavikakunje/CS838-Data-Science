aV<p>In a surprise move, Activision has released <em>Call of Duty: World at War: Zombies</em> for the iPhone.   This first person shooter is a Zombie survival mode adapted from the console version of the massively popular <em>Call of Duty</em> game.  This Zombie mode was an unlockable mode in the console version and pits you against endless waves of Zombie invaders breaking down barriers as you try to defend your position by rebuilding barricades and upgrading your weaponry.  </p>

The game comes with both single player and multi-player Co-op modes that supports bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Online play.   Yep, Online play.  That means you can match up with 3 other players around the world and play together to defend your building.  The gameplay video below shows some of this in action.</p>

aV<p>The game comes with three sets of controls: dual-stick, tilt, and swipe look.   Both touch controls are usable though people seem to be preferring the dual-stick option over swipe-look due to the sensitivity of the latter. </p>

aV<p>The game begins with you in a house with boarded up windows. Waves of zombies slowly start attacking and you need to defend against their attacks.  Windows are repaired with the press of a button, though having your attention split across the different entrances is a challenge.  The ramp up is rather slow, but soon you'll have trouble surviving the oncoming hoard of zombies.   As you kill zombies, you earn coins which can be used to buy better weapons which are found throughout the structure.  </p>

aV<p>Online multiplayer works quite well and you can get quickly matched with others looking to play.  Your co-players are seen running around the structure blasting zombies and repairing the base.  Unfortunately there's no way to communicate with your partners during the game itself, but still, we were impressed by the inclusion of an online option (shown in the video above).  </p>

aV<p>While the game is limited to one survival map at the moment, it's hard not to be impressed with the overall adaptation to the iPhone, especially with online Co-op play. </p>
