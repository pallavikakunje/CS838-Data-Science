Most people probably have one or two games they are anticipating, but the reason I look forward to that evening is because of all the games I <em>don\u2019t</em> know are coming. Often, my favorite game turns out to be one I nearly didn\u2019t even download to begin with. Last week, for me, that game was <em>FRZ: Free Racing Zero</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=914925292&amp;mt=8">Free</a>] by Fingersoft. I didn\u2019t have much confidence in it based on the title and screenshots, but it actually might be one of the best racers I\u2019ve played in several months.</p>

They\u2019re both colorful little racers played in portrait, with short, vertical courses that don\u2019t loop. They both have flawless press-either-side-of-screen-to-steer controls. They both have an upgrade system to enhance your car. And, most importantly, they\u2019re both super fun. <em>FRZ</em> is no clone, though, and it changes up the formula in some pretty great ways.</p>

aV<p>In some ways it\u2019s simpler than <em>Drift</em>. There\u2019s no boost button to worry about, so all you\u2019re controlling is the left and right steering. Don\u2019t get me wrong--boosting was definitely fun, but I\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t included here as it makes the driving feel a lot more streamlined. More significantly, there aren\u2019t a ton of extra cars bumping into you during each race, as each level sees you only racing a single ghost (with no collisions). Again, I liked that aspect of <em>Drift\u2018n\u2019Drive</em>, but it could often be super frustrating with so many other bodies pushing you around while you tried desperately to break from the pack. In <em>FRZ</em>, it\u2019s essentially just you versus the track. There\u2019s nothing random here--to win, you just need a good, clean racing line.</p>

You have more than one car to choose from here, each with their own distinct strengths and weaknesses (and they each have their own upgrades, of course). There are also tons of different tracks spread across six areas, each set in a specific environment with different hazards to contend with. Best of all, as someone who loves time trial-ing, pretty much everything in the game is ghost-based so you can race other people on the leaderboards or the standard AI.</p>

aV<p>The game is free-to-play, but--hey, where are you going? Come back! It\u2019s the good kind of free-to-play! There are no timers anywhere so you can play as long as you like. There\u2019s only one currency (used for upgrades and skins), but you won\u2019t have to grind much more than a \u201cpremium\u201d game (with one exception, see below). The prices of everything tend to be super generous, and if you\u2019re ever running low on coins you can watch a video ad and get a bunch of them (or sometimes even a free upgrade). If the game had launched without the opt-in ads and they charged money up front I wouldn\u2019t bat an eye--it\u2019s just really well balanced. In fact, I\u2019ve almost completed the career mode already without feeling any pressure to spend real money. (The final car, though, requires a <em>ton</em> of grinding to unlock. However, from what I can tell it's not needed to finish the game.)</p>

aV<p>This game hits so many right notes that it\u2019s hard to muster up any complaints, but I\u2019m a cold, heartless game reviewer so I\u2019ll try anyway. I\u2019m not a huge fan of the comic book style visuals (as I said, I almost didn\u2019t even download it). They certainly aren\u2019t bad, and the look works great in the menus, but in-game it just comes across as kind of generic. Also, the cars have a tendency to \u201csteer back\u201d when you finish a drift, which takes a little getting used to. Finally, as great as the ghost racing is, it\u2019d certainly be nice to have a few more multiplayer options (like more players on screen, perhaps).</p>

aV<p>Those complaints are all really, really minor in the grand scheme of things, though. It really feels like a game they pulled right out of my own head, as it combines many of the things I tend to look for in a racing game on mobile. The tracks are relatively short and easy to jump into at any time, there are a good number of cars with multiple upgrades to work toward, the controls are dead simple (and therefore reliable), there\u2019s a really well-implemented ghost system to encourage yourself to get better and better times, and, most surprising of all, it\u2019s completely free with a super fair economy. There\u2019s really not much else I want in a racing game. See you on the leaderboards!</p>
