There are too many games to list that share the core gameplay element of rolling a ball around a maze, and before playing <em>Labyrinth 2</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/labyrinth-2/id307758884?mt=8">App Store</a>] I thought there was little room to innovate on such a crowded genre with seemingly endless variations on the same basic game. Illusion Labs has proven me wrong, as <em>Labyrinth 2</em> is absolutely fantastic</p>

aV<p>My favorite part of <em>Labyrinth 2</em> is the online level editor, available at <a href="http://levelpack.com/">levelpack.com</a> where players can create their own levels which are then downloaded in game. The few included levels themselves are good, but pale in comparison to what the community has already created. In my time with the game I've really enjoyed myself going online each day and downloading the new level packs that other players have created. (Forum member MidianGTX has even <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=35170">started a thread</a> for discussing level creation on our forum, as well as creating the Touch Arcade level seen above.)</p>

aV<p>The creativity so far has been astounding, and now that the game is out in the wild I can't wait to see what the player base comes up with. If you've enjoyed labyrinth games in the past, <em>Labyrinth 2</em> is a must-own. If you want to sample some of the great things in <em>Labyrinth 2</em>, as we posted previously, <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2009/11/26/you-can-play-5-levels-of-labyrinth-2-right-now/">you can play 5 levels from the sequel</a> in the recently updated original <em>Labyrinth</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/labyrinth/id284571899?mt=8">$2.99</a>] and <em>Labyrinth Lite</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/labyrinth-lite-edition/id284940503?mt=8">Free</a>].</p>
