I tried to fight the urge and I failed. Second, if you\u2019re bummed that there\u2019s no <em>Super Mario</em> game on the App Store (<a href="http://toucharcade.com/2016/01/15/nintendos-first-mobile-game-releases-in-march-more-with-famous-characters-in-2016/" target="_blank">yet?</a>), then you should drop what you\u2019re doing and grab Veewo\u2019s <em>Super Phantom Cat</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1041873285&amp;mt=8">$1.99</a>] right meow. It\u2019s a fairly traditional platformer under the surface, borrowing heavily from Nintendo\u2019s resident plumber, but I have to say--that surface is flippin\u2019 <em>gorgeous</em>.</p>

aV<p>That place, apparently, is called Phantom World. You play as a cat named Chemist White who wants to become a superhero (rather than breaking bad and becoming a drug kingpin, I guess). He meets a spiky-haired guy named Flash Eyes who promises to show him how to become a phantom, which I guess will help. It\u2019s kind of hard to follow the story through the slightly broken translations in the cutscenes, but luckily it\u2019s not that important. All you need to know is that your most basic goal is to find the portal at the end of each level until you run out of them and finish the game. (And more levels are \u201ccoming soon\u201d, of course.)</p>

aV<p>Another important aspect of the game is the addition of power-ups (or \u201csprites\u201d). Pretty much every level is built around a specific ability, which you\u2019ll usually find close to the starting point. The first one you\u2019ll come across is a Bullet Sprite that allows you to shoot in the direction you\u2019re facing. Later you\u2019ll find other sprites (which bob along behind you like an adorable little balloon) like a ground pound that can drill through bricks, a teleporter, and even a bomb. (I\u2019m glad real cats don\u2019t have bombs.)</p>

aV<p>Helping you through each stage are the near-perfect controls, with a pretty standard layout of direction arrows on the left and action buttons on the right. I say \u201cnear\u201d perfect because the game lets you shift the buttons around the screen to your liking, but unfortunately you can\u2019t separate the two arrows from each other (since I usually prefer a slightly diagonal orientation), and there are only two sizes for the buttons. They can all be big or small, and that\u2019s it. Of course, really that\u2019s just nitpicking as it\u2019s perfectly possible to find a comfortable layout with what\u2019s on offer. (It\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s another control scheme as well that focuses more on dragging your finger to run and jump, but I found the regular method far more reliable.)</p>

aV<p>With its sharp and colorful visuals and classic gameplay sensibilities, <em>Super Phantom Cat</em> is a pretty perfect hybrid of the new and old. That doesn\u2019t mean the game itself is perfect, though, as there were moments when I wished the developers had been as creative with the platforming genre as they\u2019d been with the art. (<em>Wondercat Adventures</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=937258914&amp;mt=8">$2.99</a>] comes to mind as a good example of a cat-themed platformer that thinks outside the box a bit more.) Still, the level designs are brilliant and the unlockable characters are a nice carrot on a stick to keep you playing. Most important, the game is a ton of fun and feels great to play. So what if it\u2019s not that original? You love Mario and you love cats. What\u2019s the problem?</p>
