Spend enough time following the games industry and you eventually develop an elephantine level of skin thickness to ward off promotion and hype. Even being as jaded as I am towards anything but gameplay footage, every so often, I see a video or promo and I just know in my gut that I\u2019m going to love the game.</p>

aV<p>It happened for me on the PC with <em>Magicka</em>\u2019s brilliantly funny video campaign earlier this year, and when I saw the trailer for <em>Radballs</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/radballs/id436204338?mt=8" target="_blank">$2.99</a>] a gigantic smile spread across my face. I knew that if the execution of the gameplay was even half as clever as <a href="http://glowinteractive.com/">Glow Play</a>\u2019s promotional efforts that I\u2019d have a pretty wicked time on my hands. Now that the game is out? Well, I shan\u2019t mince words any longer; my expectations were both met and exceeded.</p>
p2
aV<p><span id="more-75309"></span><em>Radballs</em> is first and foremost (for me) an 80's retro lovefest. Don\u2019t confuse my meaning here; I\u2019m not talking 8-bit sprites but rather the type of art style that screams<em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVrWDPi12zE&amp;feature=related" target="_blank"> Breakin\u2019</a></em>. The colors, the patterns, and entire aesthetic are simply spot on nailed. As a gamer raised in the 80's, I found myself awash in memories of parachute pants, Z Cavariccis, Hypercolor t-shirts, Front 242, KMFDM, Ministry, New Order, and adolescent shame grown fuzzy over time.</p>

aV<p>The music for the game is fantastic, and kudos to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_voss">Neil Voss</a>\u2019 (<em>New Tetris</em>, <em>Tetrisphere</em>) work producing the soundtrack. I know I just mentioned a bunch of new wave and industrial bands, but that's not what this game is about. It\u2019s a mix of original electro tunes, tracks from lesser known artists but excellent dudes like Daze and Com Truise, and even some remixes of a few songs by Ok Go. Despite being from contemporary musicians, the electro/synth angle on all the tracks complements the games 80's vibe, dare I say, to the max?</p>
p5
aV<p>Honestly, the phrase \u201cmatch-3\u201d has such a stigma on it now that it\u2019s hardly fair to use it for fear that you will turn people off before they\u2019ve given a game a fair shake. But, that\u2019s the inspiration for <em>Radballs</em>\u2019 gameplay. Instead of lining up 3 Radballs, the goal is to build at least a 2x2 formation that then fuses into a MegaRadball. You can add additional Radballs to the formation to increase the size. The larger the MegaRadball is when it is cleared from the board, the more radness gets added to your meter. I\u2019ll come back to the meter in a bit.</p>
p6
aV<p><a href="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mzl.nktlaqnw.jpg"><img src="http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" data-lazy-src="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mzl.nktlaqnw-200x300.jpg" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-75673" title="mzl.nktlaqnw" alt width="200" height="300"><noscript><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-75673" title="mzl.nktlaqnw" src="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mzl.nktlaqnw-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></noscript></a>The way music is integrated into the game mechanics is simple and elegant. Timed to the beat of whatever track is playing, a wave will periodically travel down the screen and clear any formed MegaRadballs it passes over. The cool mechanic here is that you can directly manipulate the wave. Touch the wave and flick it back upwards, and you can buy yourself more time to build larger/more MegaRadballs to increase your bonus.</p>
p7
aV<p>Even more tubular, however, is the fact that you can grab the wave and scratch it back and forth over a MegaRadball to charge it up for extra radness. Manipulating the wave directly affects the music as if you were scratching or cutting on a record. It\u2019s this integration of the auditory experience driving the gameplay and vice versa that transforms what might otherwise be horribly vanilla into something unique and outstanding.</p>
p8
aV<p>Now, back to the radness meter. <em>Radballs</em> handles its difficulty curve better than almost any game I\u2019ve ever seen on the App Store. The game is not over when your screen fills with Radballs, it just gives you more material for matching. The only way you can lose is if your radness meter depletes over time. As you progress through the different levels, the meter depletes faster. This requires you to employ more advanced tactics and learn to effectively use the few available power-ups to be successful.</p>
p9
aV<p>For example, setting up a cascade where a MegaRadball being cleared results in another fusing together creates additional radness. Even though it took me some time to get the hang of setting up those complex formations in advance, if the meter ever started running low, I could buy myself just enough time on the radness meter to keep from losing by relying on the techniques I\u2019d already mastered.</p>
p10
aV<p>So, while the game forces you to get better, you aren\u2019t punished as you\u2019re learning. The skills you\u2019ve practiced will keep you alive enough to evolve your strategy as the game ramps up. This makes for a smooth and enjoyable ride throughout the course of the game, and eliminates the ragequit factor so prevalent in titles where time is a factor. This gives <em>Radballs</em> a bump up in the \u201cjust one more round\u201d category.</p>
p11
aV<p>Contributing to the game\u2019s longevity are two important features. Going to the settings on any level will allow you to switch from arcade mode (which ends when you clear 8 radness meters) to an endless mode that only stops when your meter depletes. This is perfect for when you just want to zone out to the music; pick a difficulty level that works for your chilling out needs and then just kick back and get rad.</p>

aV<p>Taking nothing away from the stellar soundtrack that comes included with<em> Radballs</em>, the music for any game gets old over time. Glow Play\u2019s masterstroke here was to build in the ability for players to use their own music tracks. Following the trail blazed by games like <em>Audiosurf</em> and <em>Beat Hazard</em>, this feature takes your songs and synchronizes the beat wave accordingly. You aren\u2019t just listening to your music \u2013 you\u2019re playing to it. Scratching with the beat wave has the same effect on imported tracks as native ones, making for some fun emergent experiences with songs you know and love.</p>
p14
aV<p>Add tight and responsive touch controls to a list that includes fabulous art design, awesome music, a new twist on an old mechanic, and the ability to bring in your own tracks and you end up with an experience easily worth your time and money. Oh, did I mention it\u2019s universal? Well, it is, and I highly recommend it. Your friends and peers in the forums already know <a href="http://toucharcade.com/forums/showthread.php?t=104962" target="_blank">what the score is</a>. Fire up a John Hughes flick and download it when you get a chance.</p>
