I loved <em>Cubed Rally Racer</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=373248453&amp;mt=8">$0.99</a>], and was near-obsessed with the follow-up, <em>Cubed Rally Redline</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=574202956&amp;mt=8">Free</a>]. After that, though, he started focusing on much simpler Ketchapp-style games that weren\u2019t really my cup o\u2019 tea. The last game of his (<a href="http://toucharcade.com/2015/09/22/super-bounce-back-review/" target="_blank">which I reviewed</a>) was called <em>Super Bounce Back</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1034513010&amp;mt=8">Free</a>], and it seemed to be a step back in the right direction, with a clever concept that was slightly more involved than the \u201cone-button-quick-reaction\u201d style games he\u2019d been putting out after the <em>Cubed Rally</em> series. And fortunately for me (and you, I suppose), his latest effort <em>Rocket Ski Racing</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1070329201&amp;mt=8">Free</a>] climbs out of that inverted bell curve even further. Simply put, it\u2019s a blast.</p>

aV<p>Luckily, before each regular race there\u2019s also a Gate Chase mode that helps to familiarize yourself with (or refresh your memory of) the track you\u2019re about to race on. In this mode there are ten gates that you must race through without missing any, which is fairly standard in a lot of racing games. The twist is that these gates, much like your racer, are rocket-strapped and flying forward almost as fast as you are. (That\u2019s where the \u201cChase\u201d part comes in.)</p>

aV<p>To control the game, you can either tilt or tap either side of the screen to move left and right. Or, that\u2019s what I stupidly assumed the first few times I played, anyway. I was close to rage quitting the game altogether at how jerky and imprecise the touch controls were until I realized you\u2019re supposed to actually swipe the screen back and forth, not tap. Whoops! Anyway, tilting and swiping each work incredibly well, and the best option comes squarely down to personal preference. Plus, you can tweak the sensitivity of each one in the menu.</p>

aV<p>As much as I adore the racing mechanics, controls, fantastic sense of speed, and clean visuals of the game, I do have some nitpicks. Chief among them is the way the Season works, as I detailed earlier. I\u2019m not a fan of being forced to play straight through it without being able to start over. The way it works now, if you\u2019re four races into the season and realize you\u2019re doing terribly, you have to suck it up and play through the remaining 20 before you have a chance at redeeming yourself. (The ability to watch an ad to restart your last race is a welcome touch, but not quite enough to stave off frustration in the long run). Compounding that problem is the fact that the game is really, really hard. I\u2019m usually no slouch at racing games, but hot damn did <em>Rocket Ski Racing</em> kick my butt for the first hour or so. (Hint: Stick to the blue line.) Luckily each race is pretty short, but it\u2019d be nice if there was some sort of practice mode or something to hone your skills before jumping straight into the unrelenting Season.</p>

aV<p><em>Rocket Ski Racing</em> doesn\u2019t quite reach the highs of <em>Cubed Rally Redline</em> for me, but it comes a lot closer than I was expecting. It\u2019s a great leap forward from <em>Super Bounce Back</em> (which I still enjoyed), and I hope Bailey continues this shift back toward the more arcade-y thrills of his first few games. <em>Rocket Ski Racing</em> is a very solid game from a very solid developer, and I can\u2019t wait to see what No Can Win puts out next. Perhaps we'll see <em>Rocket Ski Redline</em> someday?</p>
