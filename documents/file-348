Apply that to word games and you have Chris Garrett's <em>QatQi</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=519861748&amp;mt=8">Free</a>], a game that's as much about exploring as it is about spelling.</p>
p1
aV<p>That's not to say it isn't about spelling at all, though. Those of us with minds for 8-letter words and endless combos of prefixes and suffixes will dominate. It's just that exploration and tactics play a huge role in the breakdown of every final score, and they can't be ignored. The wide maps of <em>QatQi</em> free us from the yoke of the typical word game grid. It's a rejuvenation the genre badly needs.</p>

It has the seven-letter drawer we're all familiar with. You build off the words you place as you go, and the scoring changes based on the complexity of the letters you use. </p>
p3
aV<p>So why exploration? <em>QatQi's</em> levels are laid out like dungeons (or, less dramatically, buildings), with multiple wide-open rooms. Hidden in each of those rooms are a number of gold coins, and finding those gold coins gives you massive rewards in the score department. Each gives a large bonus to the word you put down on top of them, and each room you clear gives an extra bonus to boot.</p>
p4
aV<p>That means there are two routes to high scores in <em>QatQi</em>. One is to try to find every gold coin in each level, or as many as you can. The other is to find a few, and use them to their limits. Every letter you add to a word scores it from scratch, so coming back to a high-scoring word with new prefixes and suffixes is a great move. Those score additions include bonuses, too. It's great fun to find a high-scoring area and exploit the heck out of it.</p>
p5
aV<p>Now, as any good video-game explorer knows, finding your way into every nook and cranny requires freedom\u2014to poke around, to wander into dead ends and trace your steps back. So too in <em>QatQi</em>, where the Undo button is paramount. It feels like cheating a bit, to suss out the location of a gold coin or see into the future of your letter selection, but it's a huge part of the game. The only part of the game that costs, in fact.</p>

After that, you can buy them in packs of 1000. That's a lot of reconsidering and rearranging. On a long enough timeline, I'm certain you'll be able to throw quite a lot of money into <em>QatQi</em>. If you do, it really seems like it will be worth it.</p>
p7
aV<p>If you manage to pull together both the exploration and word-scoring elements of <em>QatQi</em>, you'll place well on the game's custom leaderboards. You'll likely place well on a few no matter what: the leaderboards are granular down to your zip code. You might need to tell your friends and neighbours if you want competition at that level, but things look a bit better from the country or world boards. If you're more keen on competing with yourself, you can see a detailed breakdown of your performance for each level you complete, one that ranks you on word length, efficiency and gold coins, among other things.</p>
p8
aV<p>All this, and it's a looker, too. There's a familiarity to its stylings, a psychedelic bubbliness that was last seen in <em>Osmos</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=382991304&amp;mt=8">$2.99</a> / <a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=379323382&amp;mt=8">$4.99 (HD)</a>]. Coincidently, the game's artist is Kun Chang, who worked on that very title. The whole thing looks a tiny bit cramped on smaller screens, but on iPad it's pretty glorious. There are a few hitches in the interface, a few places menus linger longer than they should, but on the whole it's smooth as silk.</p>
p9
aV<p>So there you have it. Depth, strategy, and looks, all wrapped around tried-and-testing word-building mechanics\u2014that's <em>QatQi</em> for you. If you're into word games, you really can't fail on this one. It's good to break out of the grid every once in a while. Stretch your legs, look around\u2014your vocabulary will love you for it.</p>
