Luca Redwood's <em>10000000</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=544385071&amp;mt=8">$2.99</a>] was an iOS gaming grand slam. <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2012/07/26/10000000-review/">As mentioned in our review</a>, the game ticked off every checkbox that makes a game impossible to put down, and since then has only gotten better with updates. <em>10000000</em> is among the games that I install first when I get a new device, and is in the same folder of iOS games that if I needed space on my device I'd sooner delete family photos than anything from it.</p>

aV<p>The followup to <em>10000000</em> was <em>supposed</em> to be the <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2014/02/03/you-must-build-a-boat/">previously announced</a> <em>You Must Build a Boat</em> which looked to build on <em>10000000</em> with some additional depth. I would've been fine with that, as would most <em>10000000</em> fans I imagine. Then Luca, or "<em>10000000</em> guy" as he's come to be known <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2014/07/10/creator-of-10000000-reveals-smarter-than-you-in-new-trailer/">released the following teaser trailer</a> for something else entirely:</p>

aV<p>The simplest way to describe <em>Smarter Than You</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=907058570&amp;mt=8">Free</a>] is a Game Center-enabled game of rock paper scissors (or roshambo depending on what you grew up calling it). You can play it like this too, randomly matching yourself with opponents then similarly randomly mashing one of your three moves. However, simply writing it off as asynchronous rock paper scissors would be doing both yourself and the game a massive disservice, as <em>Smarter Than You</em> is an incredible mind game if you're willing to let it be one.</p>

aV<p>Along with your attack, you send a message which you create by journeying through a conversation tree with up to three options at each branch. For instance, you could say something along the lines of "I always choose arrow," or something silly like "You should go for toilet." The point of all this is to bluff your opponent into choosing the option which benefits you the most. With the "I always choose arrow" example, you <em>could</em> actually choose arrow, hoping your opponent thinks you're lying and chooses something else instead <em>or</em> you could lie yourself and choose something else with the hope that your opponent believes you're going arrow.</p>
p6
aV<p>On the defending side of the turn, the information you have to go off of is limited to what they've told you and the associated point values to each of the moves. Did the tell you they're going arrow but attack is going to do huge damage? Is your opponent going to be greedy? Or maybe they'll choose counter thinking that <em>you</em> are the greedy one. The metagame is fascinating.</p>

aV<p>This is why playing with your stable of existing Game Center friends elevates <em>Smarter Than You</em> to something else entirely. Playing with people you know, either from the real world or online, can result in down to the wire games that feel like the moment you decide that you're similarly going all in with your friend across the table as he pushes all his chips to the center in a game of poker... Only to be bluffed into losing. Playing with friends is <em>stupid</em> amounts of fun, for all the same reasons that playing any bluffing based game is.</p>
p9
aV<p>The game is monetized in a way that any suit working in one of the many free to play megacorps out there would scoff at, and I think that only makes me like <em>Smarter Than You</em> more. The game is free to download, and you can play for free forever without seeing a single advertisement or being limited in any way. There's no energy, no artificial stopping points, or anything else. Instead, the game is monetized entirely through tipping other players additional experience.</p>

aV<p>Playing lots of <em>Smarter Than You</em> awards players with different pieces of flair to equip which basically just amount to graphical widgets that show off achievements. (There's even <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2014/09/24/heres-how-to-get-toucharcade-flair-in-smarter-than-you/">easy to get TouchArcade flair</a>.) As you level up through winning you'll be able to play more games against more opponents at once, as well as different types of customization like choosing the look and color of your in-game avatar.</p>
p12
aV<p>The only system which I <em>haven't</em> figured out fully is there's a way you can learn other words from your opponent. I'm really not sure where these come from, but when you play random people who use words that aren't in your in-game vocabulary options you unlock them for your own use. Perhaps everyone is seeded their own "rare" words and unlocking these words for yourself is yet another game inside of <em>Smarter Than You</em>, or maybe I'm just over-analyzing. Either way, it's a very subtle carrot on a stick that still has me playing random people even when I prefer matching with friends.</p>
p13
aV<p>Reactions to <em>Smarter Than You</em> online seem to be incredibly polarized between people who love the incredibly clever ultra-minimalistic mind game that the <em>10000000</em> guy has created... And people who are ultra-disappointed that <em>Smarter Than You</em> isn't <em>10000000</em>. Me? I love the game, and since its release my phone buzzing at night to a Game Center alert from someone taking their turn in <em>Smarter Than You</em> has definitely been keeping me up playing <b>way</b> later than I was expecting when the game was first explained to me.</p>
p14
aV<p>With a price point of $0, you owe it to yourself to at least give the game a shot. If nothing else, even if you totally hate it, it's worth paying attention to just to see how its very strange monetization model plays out in the long run.</p>
