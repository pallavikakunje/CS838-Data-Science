The sub-genre launched when wunderkind director Hideki Kamiya sat down to make another <em>Resident Evil</em> game, decided that it would be more fun if every attack felt as good as doing a headshot with a shotgun, and ended up creating <em>Devil May Cry</em>. One game does not a sub-genre make, but once Tomonobu Itagaki created his masterpiece re-imagining of <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, we were off to the races. It's not the most prolific genre, probably because it's so hard to do right, but it's seen its share of hits including the mainstream-friendly <em>God of War</em> series, the campy and cool <em>Bayonetta</em>, and the amazing parry-focused <em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</em>. These games are usually characterized by their highly-technical, deep combat, where players are graded according to how well they can dance to the game's beat. This usually involves a lot of different buttons, and we all know how well that usually works out on a touchscreen.</p>

aV<p>You take the role of a warrior named Black who is fighting zombies and other supernatural creatures that have attacked a village for extremely unclear reasons. This game has a really bizarre localization, making it very difficult to follow the plot. I'm not even sure whose dark soul I should be filling with light. Well, it's not like this genre has ever gotten by on storytelling, <em>God Of War</em> aside. The important thing is that Black has a sword and likes to kill monsters with it. He has a friend named White who likes to show up for battle in less-than-protective clothing, but she's not around most of the time, so the burden falls on you to clear out the demon infestation. You'll travel through a variety of locations, including temples, villages, and castles, stopping frequently to clear out groups of enemies that attack you.</p>

aV<p><em>Ghost Blade</em> begins in earnest from the second stage, when all of your main moves have been unlocked and the game starts throwing more interesting and deadly combinations of enemies at you. The game starts to demand that you split your attention and try to manage the whole battlefield, something that only occasionally becomes a problem when certain enemy types venture off-camera. You'll have, for example, regular melee attackers in your face, while flying eyeballs lob shots at you from a distance and witches cast powerful magic on the ground below you. The answer here might be to parry a melee attacker, launch a few into the air in the ensuring combo, give them a few slashes while they're up there, toss a few shuriken or shoot an arrow or two at the flying eyeball to put it down, then quickly roll as you hit the ground to avoid the lightning strike from the witch. It might also be something entirely different.<em> Ghost Blade</em> gives you a ton of great tools to use in battle, so how you approach each situation is going to depend heavily on your own personal style. This is one of the hallmarks of a quality game in this genre.</p>

aV<p>I know that looks complicated written out in text, but in practice, it's easy to get the hang of basic combat. Learning crowd control, how to evade, and parry timing takes some practice, but that's as it should be. Once you get the controls down, you can put together some crazy combos, and it never fails to make you feel awesome when you take down a crowd of creatures without taking a single hit. Like other games of this type, you can unlock and power up moves using orbs collected from enemies, so there's a little bit of customization in there. You'll also find new weapons and magic types as you play through the game, along with various items you can use to refill your health, extend your life meter, revive after death, and so on. Some of these items are hidden in secret rooms, so make sure to poke around the levels and see what you can uncover. At the very least, you'll frequently come across extra enemies that give you a chance to practice your moves and earn some extra power-up orbs. You can also buy any of the items from the game's shop using gems, which can be found during gameplay or purchased as IAP.</p>

aV<p>Apart from the goofy translation, the presentation is excellent. The graphics are gorgeous and the framerate is smooth on my iPhone 5S even when the screen is littered with enemies. Cutscenes are done in a comic book style that looks fantastic, and the music and most of the sound effects are quite good. Some of the groans and screams are pretty silly, and certain attack sounds could use more oomph, but that's a small bone to pick. You're given a score and a rank at the end of each stage, which gives you an incentive to replay to see if you can climb higher on the Game Center leaderboards. There's also a list of crazy achievements to try and earn if you think you've got the skills. I wish there were more than one save file, and that stages were easier to replay without having to start the game over again, though. I also would prefer if I could save anytime I wanted to instead of relying on the admittedly frequent checkpoints. Also worth mentioning is that the game is playable in portrait orientation only, just like its inspiration. Since the game is designed around it, I have no issues with it, but I know some people might.</p>

aV<p><em>Ghost Blade</em> is without question the finest example of stylish action available on iOS to date, and an essential pick-up for any fan of action games. It has a few rough edges, with the tutorials dragging on a bit too long, a weak localization that makes all the extra story details you can uncover less meaningful, and the odd enemy attacking from off-screen, but these relatively minor gripes are easily outweighed by the sheer depth and fun of its combat system. No, it's not <em>Devil May Cry</em> or <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> in your pocket, but it's still an outstanding effort for what appears to be a small, new developer. If this is what they made on their first try, I simply can't wait to see what they do for an encore. I think <em>Ghost Blade</em> is a terrific game, it's making a great impression<a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=245804"> in our forum</a>, and if you've got any love for melee action, I suspect you'll enjoy it quite a bit, too.</p>
