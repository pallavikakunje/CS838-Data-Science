Just a few days ago that game, known as <em>Pinball Dreams HD</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinball-dreams-hd/id437184410?mt=8">$4.99</a>], arrived in the App Store.</p>

aV<p>I was sort of confused as to why they would decide to remake the game seemingly out of the blue, but according to the developer they had been getting requests for iPad versions of their games ever since the iPad\u2019s release last year. But redrawing the old graphics to suit the new screen size and resolution would have been too large of an undertaking, so they started toying around with the idea of building the tables in 3D to solve those problems. After being happy with the results, they took the project full steam ahead.</p>

aV<p><span id="more-68644"></span>Now, two and a half years after the first iOS release and nearly twenty years after the original Amiga release, <em>Pinball Dreams HD</em> breathes modern life into a retro classic. Purists tend to get up in arms when people go fiddling around with their classic games, but before you go blasting hatred over your IRC channel or start calling for Cowboy Rodeo's head over the Usenet boards, you should know that <em>Pinball Dreams HD</em> uses the exact same gameplay code as the original iOS version. And, in practice, it plays nearly identical to how you remember it. It also features all the original music and sound effects.</p>

aV<p>Although I\u2019m not an original fan of the game from back in the Amiga days, I did fall in love with <em>Pinball Dreams</em> back in \u201909 on the iPhone, and it pleases me as well to see the game\u2019s integrity retained. It actually feels pretty surreal to be playing <em>Pinball Dreams HD</em> with fancy 3D graphics in your face but sweet retro sounds hitting your ears. It feels like I\u2019ve entered some sort of bizarro time warp, but I\u2019m loving every minute of it.</p>
p5
aV<p>One thing to note is that because the game is in 3D, there is a dynamic camera that follows the ball around the table. It\u2019s not quite as dramatic as the camera in Gameprom's pinball games like <em>War Pinball</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/war-pinball/id424219859?mt=8">99¢</a>/<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/war-pinball-hd/id424232330?mt=8">HD</a>], so if you\u2019re prone to nausea from those then you\u2019re probably still safe with <em>Pinball Dreams HD</em>. But the lack of any kind of camera options is annoying, especially the absence of a single overhead shot of the table.</p>
p6
aV<p>Thankfully this should be rectified with the first update to the game which Cowboy Rodeo has <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=100021">said in our forums</a> will include additional camera options as well as a few other minor fixes. They\u2019ve also pretty much confirmed that <em>Pinball Fantasies</em> will be getting this same HD treatment down the line too, and that <em>Pinball Dreams HD</em> will be hitting the Mac App Store soon. I am definitely looking forward to both of those.</p>

aV<p>One of our forum members has recorded this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">extremely lengthy</span> video of <em>Pinball Dreams HD</em> so you can see what it's like in action:</p>

aV<p>If you\u2019re a fan of the original <em>Pinball Dreams</em>, whether on the Amiga or on iOS, then don\u2019t be scared of checking out <em>Pinball Dreams HD</em>. The game still plays and feels like it always has, but now it looks fantastic in high resolution on the iPad and Retina Display devices. If you\u2019re new to the <em>Pinball Dreams</em> world, then know that you\u2019re getting 4 extremely well designed tables and one of the best digital representations of pinball ever released. It\u2019s not a very realistic pinball simulation, but in 1992 it was the pinnacle of video game pinball and that has held up incredibly well over the years.</p>
p10
aV<p><em>Pinball Dreams HD</em> is an excellent example of how to modernize a classic while still remaining true to its roots, and it\u2019s one that pinball fans shouldn\u2019t hesitate to pick up.</p>
