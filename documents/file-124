Despite its over-saturated genre and its dull name, <em>Anomaly: Warzone Earth</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/anomaly-warzone-earth/id427776640?mt=8">$1.99</a> / <a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/anomaly-warzone-earth-hd/id431607423?mt=8">HD</a>] has something new to share and its fresh conceits are executed in some of the most graceful, simple, and visually striking ways I\u2019ve seen in a long time. It nails its strategy component by providing unique constructs, it nails its controls, and it nails its look, which is really is a treat on touch devices.</p>

aV<p>The easiest way to express what <em>Anomaly</em> does is with the phrase \u201ctower defense in reverse,\u201d which sorta sounds cheesy, but it\u2019s pretty good approximation. Basically, you control the creeps in an environment laced with enemy turrets. <em>Anomaly</em> takes this idea a step further by giving you control over what kind of creeps you can build, the order in which you place your creeps,  and by also allowing you to plot out the course you\u2019ll take dynamically during the mission. <span id="more-71878"></span></p>

If there was ever a game primed for replays, this is it. It's insane flexible.</p>
p3
aV<p>You alter your direction, for the most part, because of the way the turrets are designed. Some, for example, only spit high-damage \u2018bullets\u2019 in one direction, while others blast electricity or throw out pulses that disrupt your approach. In other situations, it's the environment you'll need to plot around. All these obstructions ensures that your creep build is fluid, which makes for a very satisfying strategic experience. My lizard brain is still a little unnerved by how deep such a tremendously simple-looking game like this can be.</p>
p4
aV<p>There\u2019s a lot that goes into creep formations. Early on, you\u2019ll get the ability to trade in-game cash for armor and weapon improvements on a per level basis. Later, you\u2019ll receive the ability to buy other vehicles that flesh out a range of attack options. There's even one that can churn out one of <em>Anomaly</em>\u2019s other remarkable -- and ultimately satisfying -- mechanics: power-ups. As you kill turrets, you\u2019ll be able to retrieve powers that can mask your troops, heal them, or re-direct enemy fire. Eventually, you\u2019ll get access to a bomb that\u2019ll eliminate foes en masse according to your drop location. The implications of how you deploy  power-ups in a given situation has a huge impact on how you play, build, and move, too.</p>

p6
aV<p>The decision to render the game in a top-down perspective was an apt one, considering this is almost a god game of sorts. You direct all the movement, the moment-to-moment action, and drop power-ups onto the field with direct touches into the game world. The touch in general is precise, fluid, and native-feeling, which is awesome, but also doubly-awesome considering that this is a port of a mouse and keyboard game.</p>
p7
aV<p>One of my few issues with <em>Anomaly</em> loosely ties into the activation of power-ups. If you\u2019re not on the ball, it\u2019s very possible that you could accidentally drop one while scrolling through a level. And, hey, while we\u2019re on the subject of bad -- the writing and setup are both dreadful.</p>
p8
aV<p>None of the writing really matters, though, as it\u2019s really just a crutch for the premise of the next level, most of which bring a new design element to the table. One of my favorites is the one that has you killing specific power plants with live wiring scattered throughout the level. This premise revolves around identifying which plants to destroy first, while avoiding the lines you can't get to just yet.  In other levels, you\u2019ll also find yourself doing the normal video game stuff like escorting, protecting, and stopping enemies from damaging specific goals. Outside of the campaign, there's a tack-on mode Horde-ish mode that adds wave-based play into the mix. It's okay, but not anywhere near as entertaining as the core experience.</p>

p11
aV<p>It\u2019s ridiculous how much <em>Anomaly</em> has to offer and how natural it feels on touch devices. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of line to call it one of the best games on the market at the moment, as its easily one the visually sharpest, most well-produced, and executed out there. If you want a tower defense game that does things differently, or if you just want a solid strategy title that gives you near complete control over the experience, this is it.</p>
