Not happy with putting out just any old Massively Multiplayer Online RPG, Spacetime Studios assumed the challenge of delivering it in 3D. And it is fortunate they did, as <em>Pocket Legends</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-legends-3d-mmo/id355767097?mt=8">iPhone</a>] and [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-legends-for-ipad-3d-mmo/id362210426?mt=8">iPad</a>] has been a huge hit since its release a couple of weeks back.</p>

aV<p><em>Pocket Legends</em> puts you in direct control of one of three classes; the warrior bear, the archer hawk or the elven enchantress/mage/healer. Diehard purists will maintain that <em>Pocket Legends</em> isn't technically an MMORPG, on account of its use of instances to tell the story instead of a massive, open world. In fact, there isn't much here that could be called a story either, merely a yarn spun to connect the action and game worlds together.</p>

aV<p>That may seem a criticism, but to its credit <em>Pocket Legends</em> does not take itself very seriously, telling its tale in a few short lines each chapter and darting comfortably between zombies, moronic knights, bling and beer. The models and animations are brought fluidly to life in 3D with a range of attack animation effects and clever emotes to boot. In fact, an array of great looking weapon and equipment models, from a spiked club to a claymore, often belies the fact that you are playing a handheld MMO.</p>

aV<p>The game's camera can be zoomed and rotated by on-screen swipes and gestures, and the characters are controlled via a virtual analogue stick. Enemies are targeted by either pressing the Attack button to target the nearest or physically tapping them on-screen. This system does take some getting used to, but it ultimately offers the best of both worlds and allowing easy target switching. Naturally, <em>Pocket Legends</em> features a complete loot and inventory system as well as a number of excellently thought out skills that are progressively unlocked. Curiously, the only area where the interface is lacking is active trading between players, a feature scheduled to arrive 'soon'.</p>
p5
aV<p><em>Pocket Legends</em> is free to download, but the game plays like a Lite with in-app purchase level packs. The free portion allows you to reach level 13 for free but then you need to buy additional level packs to continue earning experience points. The included Forest Haven Campaign is one of four currently available (with another on its way soon), and the only one able to be played freely. Each pack has a different objective, with the other 3 packs costing $1.99 each and offering a variety of increasingly challenging enemies  to excel your character to the current maximum level of 25.</p>
