While virtual buttons work just fine after years of acclimating to the concept, certain experiences lend themselves well to automatic movement, but there can be concessions in terms of how much we as players are allowed to interact with them. <em>Mr. Crab 2</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1075872386&amp;mt=8">Free</a>] doesn't improve much on the foundation that was already built by its predecessor, but as an expansion of sorts, it works just fine.</p>

aV<p>Hard 2D sections have been added in thank goodness, and they work really well even when juxtaposed to the rest of the adventure. And that strong level design really is the core as there's a sense of exploration afoot, where any given nook could house a new crab baby to find,. After playing it for a few hours I started to notice all the tiny little enhancements like more gadgets to traverse. It makes for a more varied experience overall in that there's hardly a dull moment. The developers deserve a lot of credit</p>

aV<p>What really gets me about <em>Mr. Crab 2</em> is how incredible it looks. With such an unassuming name that you'll probably forget seconds after reading this review you wouldn't expect much, but the engine is beautiful, and the realistic yet surreal themes gel well together. No one color scheme overstays its welcome, and that includes the environments and the character models. It's also great that everything on-screen is clear, so it's straight-forward in terms of divining where to go next. Some zones are a bit more cryptic than others, but most are spot-on in terms of clarity. The free game is supported by video ads for the most part, which can unlock additional spins (so to speak) on the prize machine.</p>

aV<p>Of course, you'll have the option to pay $1.99 for more characters upfront, or $6.99 for every level, which amounts to buying the game outright. Given that the game is actually free, I didn't really get any sense of uncertainty or sleaze from the setup. Just keep in mind that 12 are free, and there are 64 in total, so if you don't have the patience for unlocking more through a roulette or paying for it, you might be out of luck.</p>

aV<p>Until recently I had never even heard of the <em>Mr. Crab</em> series, but checking it out spurred me into action, and having played both games, I'm glad I came across it. The second game makes some concessions for streamlining, but it ultimately comes out on top with a stronger set of stages.</p>
