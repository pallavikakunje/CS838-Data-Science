The second thing, at least for me, was that he gets beaten to death (twice). Apparent cause of death is an axe handle through the eye socket, but I\u2019m no doctor. That\u2019s a hell of a first impression for the series, adapted from Bill Willingham\u2019s Fables franchise. Fables\u2019 premise\u2014that fairytale characters have come to live in the real-world Bronx\u2014isn\u2019t uncommon: The 10th Kingdom and Neil Gaiman\u2019s American Gods both predate Willingham, and contemporary shows like Once Upon A Time and Sleepy Hollow continue the unevenly handled tradition.</p>
p1
aV<p>The violence in this introduction stands out as a way to overcompensate for <em>The Wolf Among Us</em>\u2019 inherent silliness, to convince us that it\u2019s brutal and dark. The overwhelmingly grisly murder that sets the game in motion only reinforces that idea.</p>
p2
aV<p>The bloody posturing is unnecessary, as the <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> has enough grit and texture to stand on its own without drawn-out fight scenes or swear words. The game draws its tension and mood from Fabletown\u2019s deep violets and navy blues, from a dusky soundtrack, from punchy voice-acting. The racism and classism that undergird the world of Fables are both sadder and more desperate than the blood and broken bones Telltale chooses to highlight first.</p>

p4
aV<p>Still, Telltale are remarkably efficient alchemists when it comes to Willingham\u2019s setting. They have an ear for dialogue and a genuine knack for plotting and pacing, but the promise of exploring more of the beautifully realized Fabletown is compelling too. Bigby\u2019s melodrama aside, <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> would still be interesting as a political parable, and if there\u2019s one criticism, it\u2019s that Telltale keeps the reigns too tight and doesn\u2019t offer enough chances to poke at the seams of Fabletown.</p>
p5
aV<p>Adventure games usually handle cop stories well: You talk to people, gather clues, and make connections. Bigby does those things in <em>The Wolf Among Us</em>, too, but they don\u2019t culminate in some solved puzzle as much as they change the tone and texture of Bigby\u2019s relationships with other characters.</p>
p6
aV<p>In other words, this is a narrative experience, and the game\u2019s whodunit is a plot device, not a game mechanic. Collecting evidence may unlock new dialog options, but its main purpose is to deepen the game\u2019s mystery and to force Bigby to make decisions. That said, the choices players make over the course of <em>The Wolf Among Us</em>\u2014some small, some large\u2014form the game\u2019s backbone, and every interaction seems to tie into Telltale\u2019s narrative Rubik\u2019s Cube.</p>
p7
aV<p>Unfortunately, performance problems on older devices like the iPad 2 crop up with regularity. Stuttering frame rates and delayed inputs make for shambolic action scenes and disrupted cinematics, and <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> suffers from general instability and locks up often. These technical problems are a black spot on an otherwise gorgeous game, especially since it depends on smart camera work and pacing to sustain its story.</p>

aV<p><strong>Episode 1 \u2014 Faith</strong></p>
p10
aV<p>Early in this episode, Sheriff Bigby explains to Colin that he keeps the peace in Fabletown \u201cby being big, and being bad.\u201d It\u2019s on the nose, but Colin\u2019s response cuts to the heart of <em>The Wolf Among Us</em>: \u201cDon\u2019t say that shit in front of people. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p>
p11
aV<p>Colin is decrying Bigby\u2019s chest-thumping, but it\u2019s a nice reminder that the characters in Fabletown have pre-conceived notions about Bigby, that those notions can change based on player input, and the this is primarily a game about exploring relationships in a fairytale society.</p>
p12
aV<p>\u201cFaith\u201d\u2019s strongest scene occurs in a library, where routine bureaucracy comes face-to-face with fairytale magical fantasy. There are signs of \u201creal\u201d life\u2014a deputy mayor, an administrator, public health and birth records\u2014juxtaposed with a magic lamp and an omniscient talking mirror. It\u2019s just enough to remind of you of Fables\u2019 allegorical potential while still breathing life into a mysterious new environment.</p>

p14
aV<p>Like in Telltale\u2019s previous series, <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> \u201cremembers\u201d certain choices and uses them to shape the story to come. This is an increasingly common narrative trick, but I\u2019m skeptical of games that notify the player so obviously when it happens. Granted, \u201cFaith\u201d is only the first of five episodes, so it\u2019s hard to see if and how Bigby\u2019s kindness toward, say, Bufkin will play out. What\u2019s clearer already is that Bigby\u2019s character, his relationships, and \u201cFaith\u201d\u2019s plot points are highly malleable.</p>
p15
aV<p><em>The Wolf Among Us</em>\u2019 surveillance seems like it would extend to the quick-time events that govern its fights. Bigby\u2019s potential for ultraviolence rears its head more than once in \u201cFaith,\u201d and his restraint\u2014or lack thereof\u2014should have narrative repercussions. It doesn\u2019t.</p>
p16
aV<p>The QTEs themselves are straightforward taps, flicks, and swipes. One pleasant surprise is how flexible they are: you can miss a few prompts without failing, and the fights are choreographed well enough that everything flows naturally, even when a punch or headbutt is flubbed or skipped on purpose.</p>
p17

p18
aV<p>Here\u2019s the rub: it\u2019s not always clear what a given QTE will do, or which ones can be skipped without losing the fight. This has an unfortunate chilling effect on roleplaying. In one early fight, Bigby steals an axe while a QTE prompt hovers near his opponent\u2019s neck. Thinking his next move would be to decapitate someone, I skipped it and failed the fight. I was punished for playing Bigby less violently than Telltale intended.</p>
p19
aV<p>Turns out, Bigby merely breaks the guy\u2019s jaw, but that\u2019s beside the point. When Bigby talks to people, Telltale encourages us to roleplay, to make decisions that have lasting consequences; when he\u2019s fighting someone, we get bottlenecked along a narrow path.</p>
p20
aV<p>Almost every game mechanic in \u201cFaith\u201d builds upon, changes, or informs some aspect of the narrative. With one enormous, climactic exception, the fight scenes in \u201cFaith\u201d don\u2019t. Our choices in \u201cFaith\u201d matter in one context but not the other, and that\u2019s jarring.</p>
p21
aV<p>Nevertheless, \u201cFaith\u201d puts forward a dense tale that excels at building momentum. Here\u2019s to sustainability.</p>

p23
aV<p><strong>Episode 2 \u2014 Smoke &amp; Mirrors</strong></p>
p24
aV<p>The two-month gap between \u201cFaith\u201d and \u201cSmoke &amp; Mirrors\u201d is felt right away: the finer plot points get lost in the shuffle of new characters, and \u201cSmoke\u201d struggles to find a rhythm as players try to remember who\u2019s who and why they\u2019re interrogating the Woodsman.</p>
p25
aV<p>\u201cSmoke\u201d eventually settles into itself, but it\u2019s a much shorter episode than \u201cFaith.\u201d Its brevity is compounded by the way Telltale shunts us from one scene to the next. For example, Bigby examines a headless torso early in the episode. There are several clues and interaction points to explore, but one in particular triggers Deputy Mayor Ichabod Crane to swoop in like hideous bird to shoo Bigby out of the room.</p>
p26
aV<p>You won\u2019t get another crack at the body, even if there are other clues to gather, and the implication is clear: moving the story forward is more important than investigating. It\u2019s frustrating that \u201cSmoke\u201d curtails a chance to do something both the character and mechanics are ostensibly suited for, especially since the investigation in Toad\u2019s apartment worked so well in \u201cFaith.\u201d</p>

p28
aV<p>That same pressure to move quickly exerts itself through the timed dialogue system that Telltale has been using since <em>The Walking Dead</em>. This design makes sense in the context of a zombie apocalypse, but this episode never earns the sense of urgency imposed onto it.</p>
p29
aV<p>Where \u201cFaith\u201d is violent, \u201cSmoke\u201d is seedy, taking Bigby through a strip club, brothel, and flop hotel in short order. It\u2019s unclear if this slum tourism supports a good faith effort to explore the social ills at the foundation of the Fables series, but Bigby seems poised to act as the blunt force needed to clear a path for much-needed reforms. By that same token, there\u2019s an undercurrent of class guilt and noblesse oblige in the episode\u2019s most lurid scenes.</p>
p30
aV<p>That doesn\u2019t keep the scene between Bigby and Holly from being the best in the episode. Not only does it encapsulate the game\u2019s class tension, but it also delivers on Telltale\u2019s promise of a reactive and responsive gameworld. Holly and Grendel both appreciate that I-as-Bigby decided against ripping Grendel\u2019s arm off. Indeed, the relationship between the player, Bigby, and the other denizens of Fabletown continues to be a highlight of <em>The Wolf Among Us</em>.</p>

p32
aV<p>More violent interactions are subtler, too. In the opening scene of \u201cFaith,\u201d Bigby is forced to pummel the Woodsman, whether the player wants to or not. Near the end of \u201cSmoke &amp; Mirrors,\u201d Bigby again finds himself in a brawl. This fight scene is more flexible, however, and we\u2019re allowed to lay off if need be. Bigby\u2019s restraint doesn\u2019t go unnoticed, thankfully.</p>
p33
aV<p>Still, \u201cSmoke &amp; Mirrors\u201d is more often interesting than riveting, consigned to doing <em>The Wolf Among Us</em>\u2019 dirty work: it moves the plot forward in ways that are necessary but not compelling, and touches on the series themes without revealing its hand too early. It\u2019s a short, workmanlike episode, content to stand on \u201cFaith\u201d\u2019s back and prep us for what\u2019s next.</p>

aV<p><strong>Episode 3 \u2014 A Crooked Mile</strong></p>
p36
aV<p>By episode three, <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> has settled into a familiar rhythm: Bigby talks to people, makes choices, conducts investigations, and occasionally gets stabbed, pummeled, or shot. The game\u2019s design is well established, and episode three displays the best and the worst of what <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> has to offer.</p>
p37
aV<p>Bigby and Snow spend most of \u201cA Crooked Mile\u201d tracking the birdlike Ichabod Crane. We learn, for example, that he regularly and intentionally neglects and ignores his poorest constituents, giving us insight into both his character and those found at the Trip Trap. Maybe Holly, Grenn, and the Woodsman are sullen, violent, suspicious, and anti-authoritarian because they\u2019re constantly let down by an ineffectual and unsympathetic government.</p>

p40
aV<p>Those downtrodden characters soften if Bigby is nice to them but only become rougher around the edges when he\u2019s not. On the one hand, it\u2019s great that Bigby\u2019s interactions and relationships are interesting, persistent, and reactive; on the other, <em>The Wolf Among Us</em>\u2019 social, racial, and economic subtext is sometimes a mere reflecting pool. Wherever you-as-Bigby falls along these political fault lines, <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> is too happy to spit out the attitudes you\u2019ve already put into it.</p>
p41
aV<p>Meanwhile, \u201cMile\u201d\u2019s structure is the most complex yet, giving Bigby a handful of diverging routes before shuttling him toward a climactic finish. Each new choice has a compound effect, and this episode does a good job of giving each player a somewhat personalized experience. For example, my choices led me to the ever-sinister Bluebeard and Fly Catcher, the Tweedles\u2019 dopey janitor, but I missed out on a great scene with Jack Horner.</p>
p42
aV<p>The flipside is not all possible routes through \u201cA Crooked Mile\u201d are equally fun or informative. My last stop, for example, was at the Tweedle\u2019s office, where I picked through one file cabinet before being herded to the next part of the game. Because I just happened to pick the right (or wrong) interaction point, I missed out on an entire room\u2019s worth of info, and the big reveal of the series\u2019 shadowy villains fell flat as a result.</p>

p44
aV<p><em>The Wolf Among Us</em>\u2019 fast pace and trigger-happy checkpointing system were an annoyance in the first two episodes, but in \u201cA Crooked Mile,\u201d they make the writing, plotting, and pacing feel sloppy. Telltale have built a cool world, a great noir mystery, and characters I\u2019ve grown to like, but they\u2019re sometimes betrayed by a gameplay pipeline that feels restrictive and exacting.</p>
p45
aV<p>Still, \u201cA Crooked Mile\u201d starts off incredibly strong, with a plot that moves forward and spends extra time on the series best characters. And while the climax is a bit uneven, it pulls enough weight that I immediately regretted my final decision. If nothing else, \u201cA Crooked Mile\u201d is the densest and most intriguing episode to date, a fine midpoint before what is shaping up to be a tumultuous conclusion.</p>

aV<p><strong>Episode 4 \u2014 In Sheep\u2019s Clothing</strong></p>
p48
aV<p>\u201cIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing\u201d is all about the recently (and somewhat awkwardly) revealed kingpin at the heart of Fabeltown\u2019s underworld. Bigby explores the Crooked Man\u2019s various criminal enterprises, but we don\u2019t learn much that we couldn\u2019t have guessed\u2014it\u2019s not a big stretch to guess that a vicious, murderous loan shark would also dabble in trafficking, prostitution, racketeering, and extortion.</p>
p49
aV<p>This episode may not hold too many surprises, but it doubles down on the series\u2019 thematic core in a way that makes Bigby\u2019s inevitable tête-à-tête with the Crooked Man incredibly satisfying.</p>
p50
aV<p>The large-scale conflict between Fabletown\u2019s government and the Crooked Man\u2019s mafia plays out through the game\u2019s minor characters. Without a place in society, people like Jack Horner, (Tiny) Tim, and Aunty Greenleaf find a home in the Crooked Man\u2019s abandoned church. Meanwhile, Fables like Colin and Toad remain skeptical and resentful of the government, even if they haven\u2019t resorted to crime yet.</p>

p52
aV<p>Meanwhile, Snow\u2019s assertive, authoritarian streak that began in Aunty Greenleaf\u2019s apartment continues during a showdown with Colin. After being proverbially stuffed into a fridge in the first episode, it\u2019s nice to see Snow come into her own and exert some agency, even if I don\u2019t necessarily care for her new hardline politics. Her change from a white outfit into dark grey isn\u2019t just a matter of fashion, either. (I do wish she hadn\u2019t accused me-as-Bigby of excessive violence, though\u2014I haven\u2019t dismembered or killed anybody yet!)</p>
p53
aV<p>Later, Bigby asks the un-glamoured Toad why it\u2019s \u201cso hard to just follow the rules,\u201d and the answer is that Bluebeard and Crane have rigged the game against him. \u201cIt\u2019s getting hard to tell the difference between the Business Office and Fables like the Crooked Man,\u201d Toad replies, cutting to the heart of the matter.</p>
p54
aV<p>Bigby, of course, is at the center of these rising tensions, and his moral authority as a dispenser of justice and keeper of the peace is slipping. This is especially clear at the end of the episode, when Tim points out that Bigby, in his role as Sheriff, is complicit in creating a situation in Fabletown that allowed a criminal like the Crooked Man to become so powerful in the first place.</p>

p56
aV<p>That makes for tense, terse writing as it is, but Telltale\u2019s games live and die by forcing players to make interesting decisions. Nothing in \u201cA Sheep\u2019s Clothing\u201d comes to a head, but it\u2019s clear that Bigby will soon have to choose between Snow and Colin, between doing what\u2019s right and doing what he can, between enforcing the law and trying to make Fabletown a better place.</p>
p57
aV<p>In short, the writing in \u201cIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing\u201d serves the game\u2019s most interesting decisions, and <em>The Wolf Among Us</em>\u2019 mechanics illuminate and inform this episodes\u2019 themes and dynamics. Despite being a relatively straightforward episode\u2014there\u2019s one standard fight scene, one minor branching path, and lots of exposition\u2014the link between the writing, the mechanics, and Bigby\u2019s last decision make \u201cIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing\u201d the richest episode to date.</p>

aV<p><strong>Episode 5 \u2014 Cry Wolf</strong></p>
p60
aV<p>\u201cCry Wolf,\u201d <em>The Wolf Among Us</em>\u2019 finale, has a problem: it\u2019s an entire episode of denouement, tasked with wrapping up loose ends and answering outstanding questions, usually through exposition. The main mystery driving the series\u2014who brutally decapitated Faith and Lily?\u2014was solved in \u201cA Crooked Mile,\u201d three real-time months ago. Any new information, while interesting, is tied to action that takes place before the events of \u201cFaith.\u201d</p>
p61
aV<p>That doesn\u2019t keep Vivian and Georgie Porgie\u2019s final scene from being the strongest in the episode and one of the best in the series. In it, Georgie details the Crooked Man\u2019s machinations and puts his life in sharp relief against Bigby\u2019s. In a series about decisions and their consequences, Georgie\u2019s admission that he \u201chad no choice\u201d hits home. Georgie\u2019s foul-mouthed swan song encapsulates all of the tensions and conflicts <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> has tried to explore during its run and in the process allows a violent pimp and his exploitative madame to cut tragic, sympathetic figures. </p>

p63
aV<p>The newly liberated Nerissa, like Georgie before her, spends most of her last scene ruminating on the past before offering Bigby an ambiguous farewell. Ambiguity can be a useful storytelling technique, but here it only leads to thematic inconsistency and kludgy, awkward plotting. Nerissa\u2019s revelation doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny, but it\u2019s the one moment in \u201cCry Wolf\u201d that surges forward instead of looking back. For fans of the series, the energy generated by a well-placed tease for an inevitable Season Two gives this episode a boost.</p>
p64
aV<p>Nestled between Georgie\u2019s catharsis and Nerissa\u2019s masterstroke is the Crooked Man\u2019s ad hoc trial, which should have been the apex of the episode. It\u2019s not, mostly because the Crooked Man isn\u2019t interesting enough to support \u201cCry Wolf\u201d\u2019s biggest set piece on his own. His introduction as a primary antagonist comes too late, and his motives are bland and his decisions opaque as a result. </p>
p65
aV<p>Worse, he\u2019s predictable.  His ideology and self-defense would have been easily forecast in any case, but they were also pre-empted, subtly and poignantly, by Tiny Tim at the end of \u201cIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing\u201d and Georgie Porgie in the previous scene. At some point, The Wolf Among Us shifted from gritty noir mystery to police procedural, and everyone already knows how Law &amp; Order usually ends.</p>

p67
aV<p>The courtroom scene had a secondary goal, too: to bring Fabletown regulars together to show Bigby how his actions have affected the town. My save file actually treats Bigby as if he elected to burn Auntie Greenleaf\u2019s Glamour Tree down (I didn\u2019t). This is a small bug, but it undermines the game\u2019s raison d\u2019être\u2014a reactive, internally consistent world is one of the foundational elements of The Wolf Among Us\u2019 narrative design.</p>
p68
aV<p>My own little Auntie Greenleaf glitch didn\u2019t change the way \u201cCry Wolf\u201d ends, and, most likely, neither did any of Bigby\u2019s other decisions. Bigby\u2019s choices were never going to have a huge effect on Fabletown\u2014these games have limits\u2014but it\u2019s enough to have made them.</p>
