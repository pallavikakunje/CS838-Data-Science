Then last week, the developers <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2011/07/13/new-trailer-for-reckless-getaway/">announced a follow-up title</a> to <em>Reckless Racing</em> titled <em>Reckless Getaway</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reckless-getaway/id447149103?mt=8">$2.99</a>], a game with a similar visual style and floaty physics system but with a focus on escaping capture from the police while causing a ton of collateral damage along the way. The developers had stated that <em>Reckless Getaway</em> was inspired by classic titles like <em>Spyhunter</em> and the <em>Burnout</em> series, and you definitely could see that inspiration in the trailer for the game.</p>

aV<p>Though there was no release date announced along with the trailer last week, we were pleasantly surprised to see <em>Reckless Getaway</em> show up in the App Store later that day. After spending a good amount of time with the game, and even talking about it <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2011/07/15/the-toucharcade-show-08-just-dudes-that-play-games/">on our most recent podcast</a>, I\u2019m really pleased to report that Pixelbite and Polarbit have succeeded in bringing some of the best aspects of <em>Reckless Racing</em> into <em>Reckless Getaway</em> while offering a very different gameplay experience. There are a couple of quirks here and there, and an extra dose of content couldn\u2019t hurt, but for the most part <em>Reckless Getaway</em> is an intense arcade experience with a ton of replay value that\u2019s easy enough for anybody to pick up and have a great time with.</p>

aV<p><span id="more-69216"></span>There\u2019s really no story to speak of in <em>Reckless Getaway</em>, but all you\u2019ll need to know is that you\u2019re the driver of a getaway car following a robbery and you must evade a police pursuit on the way to the end of each of the game\u2019s 16 levels. There\u2019s no gassing or braking to worry about, as the game handles this part for you. The only thing you\u2019re responsible for controlling is the left and right steering, either by tilt or arrow buttons on either side of the screen. During your getaway, you\u2019ll earn points for a myriad of activities, including driving against traffic, collecting coins, launching off one of the many jumps carefully placed in the terrain, and of course for getting the cops off your tail. As you earn points for these actions, a set of 4 stars will slowly fill at the top of the screen, and your score is based on how many stars are filled by the time you cross the finish line.</p>

aV<p>It\u2019s in this star rating system that <em>Reckless Getaway</em> gets its replay value, but also where it limits its accessibility. Just getting from the beginning to the end of a level isn\u2019t too difficult, but earning enough points along the way in order to gain 4 stars is a real challenge that will require many replays of a level as well as memorization of where the different point-earning items are. On one hand, I really like this aspect of the game as it forces you to pay attention to the details of a level and rewards you for making a clean and efficient getaway.</p>

It\u2019s not a huge issue, but I\u2019d appreciate a more forgiving way to see the advanced levels in the game, and then have the option to go back and earn 4 stars on previous levels if I choose to. As it is now, sometimes I feel forced to perfect a level even if I\u2019m not ready to just to earn an extra star or two to keep progressing in the game.</p>

aV<p>The thing that makes the odd progression structure easy to forgive is that <em>Reckless Getaway</em> is just damn fun to play. Just about every playthrough of a level feels like a high-octane chase scene from an action flick. The floaty physics and touchy steering ensure that you\u2019ll pinball off of traffic and the many hazards in the terrain, making for plenty of memorable moments. The handling is about as far from a simulation game as you can get, but this actually benefits the arcade nature of the gameplay. One thing <em>Reckless Getaway</em> could really benefit from is some sort of endless or freeplay mode where you could just drive fast and cause destruction to your heart\u2019s content.</p>

aV<p>For such a simple arcade game, <em>Reckless Getaway</em> actually contains quite a bit of depth and strategy in obtaining every star. If you\u2019re just looking for some mindless vehicular mayhem, then it delivers that in spades as well. Those looking for a more traditional racing game may choose to stick with <em>Reckless Racing</em>, or hang around for the proper sequel <em>Reckless Racing 2</em> which has Pixelbite <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showpost.php?p=1827969&amp;postcount=110">has confirmed</a> is already in progress. <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=100451">Players in our forums</a> have had tons of positive things to say about the game, and for some high-action arcadey gameplay <em>Reckless Getaway</em> is one to check out.</p>
