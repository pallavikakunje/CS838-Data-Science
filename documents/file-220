On the surface that sounds absurd, but think about it a little deeper. Computers absolutely demolish us when it comes to things like math and chess, and some of our most creative ideas come when we\u2019re sleeping or thinking of other things. Your brain stem is an incredibly quick chunk of meat, and it could be argued that consciousness just slows it down. Imagine if self-awareness was required to remove your hand from a hot stove, for example. Yikes.</p>

It\u2019s a reaction game that tasks you with controlling two characters at once on either side of a vertical level, and I could feel my conscious brain letting me down with every failed tap of the screen. If only I could be more\u2026 <em>machine</em>-like. Pure reaction with no pesky awareness getting in the way and mucking things up. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, this game is hard. It\u2019s really, really hard. But it\u2019s hard in a good way: satisfyingly challenging, with every single mistake being your fault and yours alone.</p>

aV<p>You play as the titular Digit and Dash, two robots in love trying to defeat the evil hot dog person who split them up. (These things happen, alright?) On the left side of your screen is Digit, and on the right is Dash. They run from the bottom to the top along what is essentially a straight line with various traps and enemies along it. Tapping on either side will force that robot to jump over an obstacle. Pretty standard stuff. However, the two robots can also work together to clear greater obstacles, and that\u2019s where the game really starts to get clever. While one robot is in the air, you can tap again and they\u2019ll slam into the \u201cground\u201d and send the other robot into an even higher jump. Those are your main moves, but you can also bounce on enemies to get even more air, and jump on various buttons that act like power-ups.</p>

Eventually it\u2019ll all click, though, and you\u2019ll be sending the robots over obstacles and bouncing off enemies with the greatest of ease. Except that you probably won\u2019t, because the game ramps up the difficulty incredibly fast. (And just to pour salt in the wound, after you finally pass a level it\u2019ll helpfully tell you how many times you died on the way toward your goal.)</p>

aV<p>The game has five worlds, each containing five levels and one boss fight. If you really hate yourself, you can try to get three stars on each level by revisiting them and collecting all the letters and golden atoms. Good luck with that.</p>

aV<p>Yet, as brutal as the game is, it\u2019s undeniably fun. It just feels great to play. Even right now, as I sit here writing this review, I\u2019m itching to dive back in and get my ass handed to me on a silicon platter a few more times. It looks and sounds pretty darn good as well, for an overall package that is very well worth the two dollar asking price (and no IAPs!). I do wish it had an endless mode with Game Center leaderboards, but that\u2019s just me gettin\u2019 all greedy. What\u2019s here is awesome, and you know what? I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve got my consciousness to enjoy it.<br>\u000a</p>
