Still, it\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve enjoyed a tried and true classic take on the rhythm genre. <i>Pianista</i> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1171622506&amp;mt=8">Free</a>] is an excellent new title that offers that exact experience with the added benefit of a treasure trove of classical music. In fact, when you combine the well-designed rhythm system with an interesting freemium system, there\u2019s really no reason not to at least check it out.</p>

aV<p>As a rhythm/music game, <i>Pianista</i> harkens back to the classic lane-based gameplay in which you tap notes to the tune of a rhythm. Specifically, there are six lanes to keep track of with taps, single-lane holds and multi-lane holds. While the move-set is limited, <i>Pianista</i> makes up for it with an incredibly responsive engine that is synced perfectly with the music and has no slowdown. It\u2019s a good thing too, because these songs are pretty damn difficult.</p>
p3
aV<p>Of course, when you consider the classical nature of the song selection combined with the fact that you\u2019re playing the piano sections for each of those songs, it\u2019s really no surprise that <i>Pianista</i> would be difficult. Sure, there are some easy tunes such as Bach\u2019s Minuet, but once you get to Beethoven\u2019s Moonlight or Rachmaninoff\u2019s Flight of the Bumblebee all semblance of easy gets thrown out the window. Thankfully, <i>Pianista\u2019s</i> two-tier difficulty works for the most part, with Normal offering most of the notes for any given song with a large threshold for missed notes. Meanwhile, Technical is an unforgiving mistress with very little margin for error. I\u2019d like to consider myself fairly competent in this genre, but there are a lot of songs that are downright challenging on Technical, which at the very least makes for some decent replayability as you try to master them.</p>

aV<p>Unfortunately, getting to the songs you want to play may take some time, which is due to <i>Pianista\u2019s</i> interesting freemium system. Players get a certain number of \u201cfree songs\u201d with one song being replenished every few minutes. These songs can be cashed in while playing the game\u2019s \u201cGolden Play\u201d mode, which rewards coins for completing songs that are randomly selected. Earn enough coins and you can buy a song in \u201cCollection Play,\u201d which will then let you play that song to your heart\u2019s content. You\u2019ll want to purchase these songs too, because it\u2019s a pretty amazing hit list of classical music from over a dozen artists that you\u2019ve probably heard before in some form or fashion.</p>

aV<p>While it\u2019s a novel system that allows players to theoretically be able to play any song up front without paying anything, I found the timer system to be a little tough, particularly when it comes to the total amount of songs that you can bank. Also, songs cost an insane amount, meaning that you\u2019ll have to play and beat 15-20 songs in the random Golden Play mode before you can purchase one song. If you\u2019re keeping up with the timers somewhat regularly, that should translate to a song or two to purchase a day. Again, not too unreasonable, but considering the likelihood of replays during Golden Play, I can imagine the game getting boring fairly quickly. There\u2019s always the IAP route of course, but that route equates to one song purchase for every 3-4 dollars, which feels a bit high.</p>

aV<p>If you can look past the song purchasing system and think of <i>Pianista</i> as a fun rhythm game that throws some very high quality music at you to play in a random order, then it\u2019s pretty top notch. Despite my concerns raised above, I had no problems thinking of the game in this fashion, meaning that it\u2019s very possible to thoroughly enjoy the title and just think of the song purchases as nice bonuses. The developer has also promised a score attack competitive mode, which should also add to the game\u2019s general replayability. Finally, considering the very high quality of the song selection (along with the refined rhythm system), there\u2019s really no reason why fans of rhythm games or classical music can\u2019t at least try it out to see if it suits their fancy.</p>
