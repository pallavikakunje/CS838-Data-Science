aV<p>Back in January we heard <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2011/01/03/exclusive-preview-of-cope-coms-battle-squadron-on-the-ipad/">the excellent news</a> that <a href="http://cope-com.com/">Cope-Com</a> would be bringing an exact port of their classic <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=135">Amiga shooter </a><em><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=135">Battle Squadron</a></em> to iOS. Originally released for the Amiga in 1989 (arriving on the Genesis / MegaDrive the following year), <em>Battle Squadron</em> is widely considered one of the very best Amiga shooters ever released and is probably my personal favorite 2D shooter of all time. And, I know Arnold Kim spent plenty of time with this one on his Amiga 500, as well.</p>

I'm happy to report that, at long last, Cope-Com released the Universal application (for iPhone and iPad)<em> Battle Squadron ONE</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/battlesquadr1/id439240591?mt=8">link</a>] into the App Store. And, any self-respecting shooter fan (of a retro bent or no) needs to take notice.</p>

The game features four scrolling level environments, huge numbers of enemy craft, 24 different weapons (four types with six power levels each), Nova Missile smartbombs, four powerful end-bosses, and three different levels of difficulty. Three different control modes have been worked into the iOS version: direct touch (at both "Amiga speed" and "keep up with my finger speed" modes), tilt, and virtual joypad. Game Center integration and daily leaderboard updates are there, and a simultaneous two-player mode is coming in a free update.</p>

aV<p>Have a look at Cope-Com's gameplay video, with co-creator Martin Pedersen narrating. A longer demo that I captured of a recent, pre-release build of the game can be seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfSyc_rozIU">here</a>.</p>

aV<p>To ensure solid performance, the developers have limited <em>Battle Squadron ONE</em> to iOS 4 and the iPhone 3GS, 3rd-generation iPod touch, iPad or better.</p>
p7
aV<p><em>Amiga Computing</em> magazine, way back when, gave the original <em>Battle Squadron</em> a 109% review rating. I was thrilled with my $40 purchase of the game in 1989. <em>Battle Squadron ONE</em>, at $1.99 USD, is excellent gaming, folks. Do not miss it.</p>
