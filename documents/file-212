Thankfully, most of them tend to be free, but there are still a few that are a dollar or even two (twice as much!). Even worse, most of these games only use a couple of my iPad\u2019s features. I mean, if I\u2019m going to break the bank on a game that <em>costs money</em> it had better be utilizing my whole device. (Example: I bought <em>Horizon Chase</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=991018252&amp;mt=8">Free</a>] earlier this year for three entire dollars and quickly found that it only uses my touchscreen. What about the gyroscope? The microphone? The camera? <em>Eeeeyoo, eeeyooo!</em> Ripoff alert!) <em>Progress to 100</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=959954514&amp;mt=8">$0.99</a>] is yet another of these wallet draining \u201cpremium\u201d games, but I quickly found that this one is different. As I played through its hundred levels, it slowly began to dawn on me: This game uses <em>everything</em>. Finally!</p>

I\u2019m not sure if that means making it through the 100 levels, or completing 100% of the game, but it doesn\u2019t really matter since they are basically the same thing in this case. Over the course of several days I did manage to progress all the way to 100, and the experience was definitely not like anything else I\u2019ve done on my iPad.</p>

aV<p>And yet, in another way, it absolutely was like <em>everything I\u2019ve done on my iPad</em>. At various points I found myself twisting it, flipping it, turning on Airplane mode, holding it perfectly flat against a wall, plugging it into a charger, and pretending it was a bottle of champagne. And the only thing I got drunk on was <em>puzzling</em>.</p>

The game will also speak to you from time to time through the voice of a British woman, who is either helpful or scolding, depending on how you\u2019re doing. Your job is to figure out what the game wants you to do, and once you\u2019ve done that thing, you\u2019ll move on to the next puzzle. Often you\u2019ll be interacting with the words themselves (\u201cStand on it\u201d wants you to press the word \u201cit\u201d), or sometimes the screen will be nearly blank and you\u2019ll just need to tap around (or move your device) until something starts to happen. Luckily, true to it\u2019s name, each level acts as a sort of progress bar with a lighter screen gradually replacing the darker screen you begin with to show that you\u2019re on the right track.</p>

aV<p>It\u2019s a super clever idea, in that it basically combines just about every random gimmick you can think of that iOS devices can do and mashes them all into a puzzle game. It works really well, too, and I basically never had a moment where I knew what I was supposed to do and couldn\u2019t. The tilting and everything is calibrated just right to get each task accomplished with very little frustration, leaving nothing in your way as you try to think outside the flat, metal-and-glass box you\u2019re holding.</p>

aV<p>Of course, I\u2019m always striving to find something to complain about (I\u2019m super fun at parties), and I did manage to find a few small things to take issue with. First of all, a few of the puzzles are solved by doing <em>exactly the opposite</em> of what the nice lady voice tells you to do. For instance, one level basically asks you to just wait and do nothing. So I just let the iPad sit for several minutes, and still nothing happened. Finally I realized you are actually supposed to tap despite her protests and thus solved the puzzle. On the one hand, it\u2019s cool that it requires a bit of experimentation sometimes. On the other hand, it feels a bit cheap when following the instructions gets you nowhere. Also, the length of the game is a bit short. I played in short bursts over almost a week, but I can\u2019t imagine it would take more than 45 minutes to solve the entire game in one sitting.</p>

aV<p>Are either of those things really \u201cbad\u201d, though? It can feel really good to poke and prod a puzzle until it\u2019s solved simply through trial and error, and the length isn\u2019t that problematic since it packs such a cool experience so densely into a neat little one-off puzzle game. Plus, they could always update it with more levels (and, judging by the clever final \u201clevel\u201d, they intend to). In any event, it\u2019s still a super enjoyable game despite any flaws--if you could even call them flaws. Maybe my favorite thing about <em>Progress to 100</em>, though, is that most games have one or two gimmicks, and I think there\u2019s something to be said for a game that has <em>all</em> the gimmicks.</p>
