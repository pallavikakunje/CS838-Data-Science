Think of a noun, type it in, and then the game conjures whatever you chose to aid you in a puzzle. Need to find a way to reach a button on a cliff above the sliding door it controls? Hop on a pegasus. Want to bury a dead man? A stylish coffin, a shovel, and a spot of dirt will do the trick. <em>Remix's </em>brilliance is in its ability to let you use <em>any</em> tool to solve <em>any</em> puzzle. It cradles creativity unlike any other game, and <em>Remix</em> isn\u2019t shy about letting you play in its world, to create all the fire-breathing dragons or toasters you can handle.</p>

aV<p>If you said <em>Remix</em> is a Best Of port of <em>Super Scribblenauts</em> and <em>Scribblenauts</em>, you wouldn\u2019t be wrong. <em>Remix</em> is the sum of those core experiences with added touch controls that can, in some instances, feel inorganic. It strikes me as more of an upgrade, though. The game engine has a noticeably sharper look and feel, extraneous movements and navigation elements have been stripped or streamlined, the play is generally snappier, and some new levels have been thrown in for good measure. While 5th Cell didn\u2019t re-invent the wheel with <em>Remix</em>, it did bother with the balance, weight, and treads on the thing. <span id="more-78868"></span></p>

The progression is incoherent -- in one level you\u2019ll tune a race car, in others you\u2019ll carry around a dead man, set up a school for the first day of class, or hide a lion in front of a magic show\u2019s audience. The constant is the gleaming Starite, which is your reward for fulfilling all what is required.</p>
p3
aV<p>The majority of scenarios aren\u2019t really the hotbed of creativity that I\u2019d love for them to be. Sure, you could conjure a winged dragon or a vampire in the school house level, but what the game is going to credit you for are the basics: chairs, desks, podiums, and all of that rather dull school-y stuff. There are some significantly more open experiences to be had. The first level, for example, simply charges you with sniffing out the actual Starite in a tree filled with impostors. I used  a flamethrower against the tree to burn everything out of it because I\u2019m a jerk, but it totally worked.</p>

Most of the time, I use them as extra encouragement to think outside the box. Sure, I <em>could</em> give the hairdresser scissors, but wouldn\u2019t it be a funnier if I gave her an exceedingly more creative object to snip her client\u2019s hair? Some of the more open levels, on the other hand, do require critical thought. Creating a mass extinction event without asteroids is harder than you think. If you ever get stumped, the game does a decent job with its hint system giving you all the teases you need to succeed while still not robbing you of those glorious \u201cA-Ha!\u201d moments.</p>
p5
aV<p>Like in other <em>Scribblenauts</em> titles, you\u2019ll need to do a measure or two of moving, probably most often to mount that flying dragon you just created. The touch controls function well for the most part. A simple tap to the levels borders steers Max, while shakes remove everything you created and two-finger swipes allow you to look at the map. Actions like jumping and climbing are automated to maximize your leisure and sharp radial menus handle all the \u201cremove or give object\u201d kind of functionality. The iPad\u2019s regular virtual keyboard is your magical conduit to the game and noun creation.</p>

And what you can do almost magical. Want to watch God fight a T-Rex? Make it happen. Want to see what happens when you throw a caveman or a toaster into a pond with a shark inside of it? Go ahead. The casual disregard of the actual objectives is actually an empowering side-mechanic that really, somehow and someway, allows you to experiment and conjure alternative solutions to the fairly simple problems the game might throw your way.</p>
p7
aV<p>The introduction of adjectives and the adjective-leaning puzzle levels really flesh out the experimental play. In one level, for example, you\u2019ll be asked to make a man into a dragon with some mad genius potions. Thinking of which attributes you think are important to dragons and then applying them to potions is nothing short of entertaining, just like the game\u2019s open and sandbox-y world. If you want to do it, you probably can. It\u2019s insane and great all at the same time. It\u2019s indescribably fantastic to wield so much power.</p>
p8
aV<p>It\u2019s pretty cliche to write in a game review, but I really think you\u2019d be doing yourself a disservice by not checking out <em>Remix</em>. It\u2019s an utterly fascinating game that isn\u2019t afraid to put significant power in your hands. It utterly embraces creativity and brims with extremely satisfying moments and stories to share as a result.</p>
p9
aV<p>Publisher WBIE could have <em>easily</em> had this phoned in and still made stupid amounts of money, but it didn't; this is a rock-solid pseudo-port that plays extremely well on mobile and displays a measure of technical and mechanical grace none of us expected it to. Oh, and it's Universal and supports iCloud saves across devices -- icing on the cake, folks.</p>
