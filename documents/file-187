Micromanaging troops and building an empire is an unparalleled joy in some cases. For some titles, it was all about just getting through the day, and taking out an enemy force. But for others, it was about managing an economy, and growing over time to support your people. They\u2019re the kind of games that lend themselves well to short or marathon sessions, where you can just pop in, stress free, and take care of business. The mobile arena is a perfect fit for that type of game, and <em>Super Tribes</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1006393168&amp;mt=8">Free</a>] is happy to accommodate.</p>

aV<p>Control-wise, the game doesn\u2019t even need a tutorial, though there are a few quick tips to assist you on your travels. <em>Super Tribes</em> is turn based, and a resource counter (denoted by stars) highlights your maximum move count during each turn. So for instance, you may have the option to build something, harvest fruit, train a new warrior, or explore, and all of that costs a specific amount of stars. How you choose to approach the game is up to you, and every action is done with a simple tap.</p>

aV<p>I love the visual style, full stop. It\u2019s bright and has a papercraft vibe to it, and the screen real estate is just fine for checking out everything available. The text and UI size is basically perfect, so you won\u2019t need to squint to see anything even on a phone, nor will you feel frustrated by tapping on the wrong portion of the map. By tapping on the research icon players will open up a giant tree, providing tech advancements like hunting, fishing, or even climbing -- which again, costs resources. Since every game is ostensibly different, players may want to adjust their style according to that game, trying out new tactics and ways to approach the enemies at hand.</p>

aV<p>Once the 30 turn marker hits, that\u2019s all she wrote. The game ends, and your score is tallied (taking into account difficulty levels, how big your creation is, and so on), and then you\u2019re off to start a new journey. It\u2019s a very linear session in a way, which may turn some people off. But to me, it\u2019s conducive to the mobile playstyle, where even if you decided to engage longform, nothing feels draw out to the point where you feel the urge to put down your phone or swap to another more exciting app. Yep, it just has one mode of play, and that\u2019s \u201cgo.\u201d There\u2019s no extras involved or advanced options -- you take the hand you\u2019re dealt.</p>

aV<p>This is an easier pill to swallow because IAP is basically nowhere to be found in this game, which is great news since other strategy tiles are often bogged down by it. I said \u201cbasically\u201d because there is the option to buy an extra army, but it doesn\u2019t really make a consequential difference in the sense that you feel like you\u2019re missing out by not having it. In other words, there are no timers, no annoying currencies to have to grind for or buy -- it\u2019s all just there. It sounds absurd, but the fact that the developers weren\u2019t greedy pays off in the end, since the pacing is kept up throughout given that the experience is balanced around not paying, or attempting to make people pay.</p>

aV<p><em>Super Tribes</em> does one thing, and it does it well. There\u2019s really no secret Easter eggs to discover, no advanced strategies or mathematical equations that you\u2019ll have to decipher that you won\u2019t find out for yourself after a few hours of play. It\u2019s a great city building game that\u2019s free of the shackles of \u201cfreemium,\u201d and every strategy fan owes it to themselves to give it a shot at some point.</p>
