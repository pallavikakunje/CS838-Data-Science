aV<p>Instead of pumping out a sequel using their tried and true formula though, Kairosoft felt that a little change was in order. They decided that instead of creating a new game development sim, they would jump way across the zen garden and create <em>Hot Springs Story</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hot-springs-story/id408854559?mt=8">$3.99</a>], a full on sim in the realm of <em>Sim City</em>. Gone are the zany people that you could hire and fire; the people are now just customers that come and go at will.</p>

aV<p>My road down nostalgia lane isn\u2019t precluding a bad game though, as <em>Hot Springs Story</em> is quite possibly the most soul sucking game (in the best way possible) that I\u2019ve played since... <em>Game Dev Story</em>. Like a typical building sim, <em>Hot Springs Story</em> lets you build \u201crooms\u201d in a new, up in coming spa. You build rooms to sleep in, spas to steam in, little restaurants to eat in, Panchinko rooms to gamble away all your money, etc. Being a Japanese style spa though, the challenge of the game comes with creating a zen-like environment for your customers. Certain items will get boosts when placed next to certain items, while others items need to be placed next to natural rocks and pretty plants to succeed. Try to get cutesy and western with blocks of this and globs of that though and you\u2019ll create yourself a hot springs disaster. Don\u2019t you dare ruin it for the locals. </p>

In addition to just building your zen paradise, it\u2019s up to you to buy add on booster items for different rooms, buy new rooms altogether, invest in different companies around the city for various reasons, advertise to different target groups, and submit to different magazines for spa rankings. Winning first place in the hot springs magazine isn\u2019t quite as awesome as having the creepy bear mascot from the trade show in <em>Game Dev Story</em>, but the larger than life trophy you get is a nice prize indeed.</p>

aV<p>While fans (and superfans... there are plenty in our forum) of <em>Game Dev Story</em> will undoubtedly be thrilled with <em>Hot Springs Story</em>, newbies to the land of Kairosoft will probably cringe a bit at the less than perfect graphics and the initial chaotic nature of the action. There\u2019s a lot going on at once, and until you really get the hang of what everything does it can seem daunting. Stick with it though and you\u2019ll definitely be rewarded with some of the best gameplay in the App Store. Just think of Kairosoft as that band that was tough to grasp but eventually rewarded you with some kind of religious experience. You\u2019ll thank me later.</p>
