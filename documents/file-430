aV<p>Moments like these happen once every five-to-ten minutes in Kairosoft\u2019s latest simulation, which puts you in the shoes of a bustling mall\u2019s planner, a mall's coordinator, a mall's CEO, and a close-proximity real estate tycoon. The last conceit is the most compelling one: few tower games give you control over more than the tower itself. Being able to raise up a community by purchasing house, parks, parking lots, and more gives you a unique stake in the outside world. It makes you feel like the universe is your baby, not just the mall.</p>

The point, as always, is to profit and hit a certain status by buying new shops, unlocking new stores, combining places to maximize the selling power, and cater to a specific audience in the fastest way possible. Fast is a theme in general, as you\u2019ll need to service people as quickly as possible by building elevators, stairs, and escalators amongst your stores.</p>

aV<p>As you plan, you\u2019ll upgrade and endlessly iterate on what you\u2019ve already built. In <em>Mega Mall Story</em> specifically, shop upgrades such as increased stock, new stock, and quality are handled via a social currency: hearts. When people like what you\u2019ve done, you receive a few of these. Kairosoft is generally pretty good at making people matter, and this micro-game is as important and fulfilling as ever.</p>
p6
aV<p>Even if you aren\u2019t turned on by the social component, the grand carrot-on-the-stick approach that Kairosoft has mastered is probably enough to keep you going. In this game particularly, almost everything you do nets some sort of reward. Build a store and people come to it? It levels up. Reach a certain popular status? You get a buying frenzy. Reach goals set by a ratings commission? Your store becomes even more powerful. Build a recreational park? Hey, wouldn\u2019t you know it, more upgrades are now available!</p>

aV<p>In some ways, this can be the most frustrating part of the game. When you first start out, you have a mental image of what you want your tower to be and how you want to build. But, as you progress, the game tortures that image and, eventually, breaks it by introducing stores and features in the stream that it does. On the other hand, it\u2019s a heck of a driver if you can get over your OCD tendencies. Also, <em>Mega Mall</em> has a pretty rich suite of re-building and moving functionality because it\u2019s aware of how it could theoretically burn you.</p>

aV<p>Aside from a few game-side logic quibbles, the one problem that I have with this game is that it\u2019s a mess to control, particularly when it comes to the camera. Your tower will eventually get bigger than the screen can hold, which means you\u2019ll need to scroll from side-to-side as you plot out your Next Big Thing. Meanwhile, you\u2019ll probably click on stuff you didn\u2019t mean to or, as I often do, accidentally \u201cremove\u201d items that I didn\u2019t want to. Connected to this issue is the fact that <em>Mega Mall</em> is, straight-up, an extremely visually busy game. The iPad 2X option helps you with the mess by sheer virtue of it blowing the image wildly out of proportion.</p>

aV<p>I\u2019m not sure that this thought will be shared by other Kairosoft fiends (like the ones in <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=103344">the thread in our forums</a>), but as I\u2019ve been exploring <em>Mega Mall Story</em> I\u2019ve convinced myself that this is its most cohesive title. All of its pieces fit snug and everything you do contributes to a whole package. It\u2019s also one of its most wide-reaching games, combining social and sim aspects from all over the place. I don\u2019t know what else I want, and that\u2019s really the greatest bit of praise I can give it. Go download it, already.</p>
