aV<p>Racing to get into the game, I skipped the tutorial because I\u2019ve done this before. I\u2019ve crafted ALL the craft. Everything is as I expected; your custom character drops into a randomly-generated world, and you're off. Chop down trees for wood and then turn wood into walls. Turn walls into castle, and then turn castle into the USS Enterprise.  All of it is here, except now in beautifully pixelated 2D sprites.</p>

aV<p><em>Terraria</em> did not stop at simply crafting and building, though, it has a combat systems too. When you've got your sword swinging, it plays much like a clunky-er Ghouls n\u2019 Ghosts as you defend yourself from one-eye freaks, and Jell-O-blobs, that lurk about the night you reap their spoils. Those spoils allow you to craft better stuff. Things like armor, weapons, furnishings, tools, etc. Combat remains to be <em>Terraria</em>\u2019s stand-out trait from the competition, giving the player more vibes of action-adventure RPGs than any other genre-heavyweight I\u2019ve played.</p>

aV<p>It\u2019s no lie this game is systems-heavy, so if you enjoy bouncing between complex systems <em>Terraria</em> has you covered. The joy of this genre is exploring, uncovering secrets, and discovering systems you never expected to exist and as such it\u2019s a disservice to the product to overly explain everything it has to offer. But, what is safe to say, is that the game will constantly surprise you as you delve deeper into what is possible both with building and exploring. Of particular note is your buildings actually serve a purpose to house NPC's, rather than just being yet another abandoned wizard tower in your <em>Minecraft</em> world, and much, much more.</p>

aV<p>Yet, with all this praise, <em>Terraria</em> still has a lump to complain about. Surprisingly enough, it\u2019s not in the control department either. The virtual controls worked perfectly fine for me, after a bit of practice, with little to no hiccups.</p>

aV<p>Instead, the lack of multiplayer at launch is the biggest bummer. I also experience some odd frame-rate issues during my time as a lumberjack, on my iPad 2 but this doesn't seem to be an issue at all on newer hardware. On the topic of iPad: if you\u2019re not playing <em>Terraria</em> on one: expect to potentially be dealing with a few frustrations stemming from lack of screen-real-estate. I'm hopeful an eventual update will bring over the multiplayer we desire, but that\u2019s a make-or-break-point in a week in which <em>Terraria</em> launches alongside a new <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2013/08/30/toucharcade-game-of-the-week-junk-jack-x/">Junk Jack</a> game.</p>

aV<p>I\u2019m not here to compare every game of this kind, nor do I care to play them all. What I know is: <em>Terraria</em> takes a different approach to a formula proven by <em>Minecraft</em> in perspective, combat, immersive-storytelling and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 moments of discovery. It's a treat, especially on the App Store where it seems like developers are just racing to clone <em>Minecraft</em> rather than bring any kind of innovation to the table.</p>
p9
aV<p>While by no means a replacement for the full PC version of <em>Terraria</em>, this pint-sized iteration is an effortless recommendation. We've been waiting forever for <em>Terraria</em> to arrive, and while the additional screen real estate of the iPad makes it a bit more fun to play on the larger-screened device and multiplayer would be a welcome addition, this is just as much of a must-have for <em>Minecraft</em> fans as <em>Junk Jack X</em>.</p>
