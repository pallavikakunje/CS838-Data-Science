It\u2019s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect" target="_blank">Tetris Effect</a>, and I\u2019ve always thought it was weird that people considered it strange enough to warrant its own name. Pretty much <em>anything</em> I get super into will start to invade my thoughts and dreams when I close my eyes. Isn\u2019t that pretty normal? Why is <em>Tetris</em> special? Certainly there are plenty of iOS games that give me the same \u201ceffect\u201d when I play them long enough. Like <em>Swapperoo</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=999771588&amp;mt=8">$0.99</a>], for instance.</p>

aV<p><em>Swapperoo</em> is a new game that has definitely been giving me what I\u2019d call a \u201cMatch Three\u201d effect, in that I have a weirdly strong urge to shift imaginary shapes around and clear matches even when I\u2019m not playing the game. Of course, this probably wouldn\u2019t be happening if the game was terrible, and indeed it\u2019s not. In fact, it\u2019s easily one of the best and most inventive puzzle games I\u2019ve played in quite some time.</p>

aV<p>For example, you don\u2019t swipe tiles to make matches like in <em>Candy Crush</em>. You don\u2019t slide rows like in <em>You Must Build A Boat</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=811397653&amp;mt=8">$2.99</a>]. You don\u2019t drag pieces around like in <em>Puzzle &amp; Dragons</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=563474464&amp;mt=8">Free</a>]. In <em>Swapperoo</em>, each tile has a certain shape that can only move in certain ways. Tapping an arrow piece, for example, shifts that piece in whatever direction it\u2019s facing. Tapping a circle will pop it like a bubble, causing the pieces above to fall down one space. Squares can\u2019t be moved at all (by you, anyway). Those are the basics, but there are variations on each shape as well. There are drill arrows that destroy--rather than swap with--the piece they face, and certain squares are completely fixed in place and can\u2019t be moved at all. There are grey pieces that won\u2019t match with anything, spiral portals, and several other pieces that behave in unique ways.</p>
p4
aV<p>On top of all that, there are also special \u201ceye\u201d tiles that have further unique properties. Skull Eyes, for example, will blow up and end the game if you don\u2019t clear them within a certain number of moves. Star Eye tiles are usually part of an objective and a certain number of them need to be cleared to pass a level. Finally, Heart Eye tiles must be protected at all costs and Big Eye tiles will hunt them down and end your game if too many are destroyed. Actually, there are <em>even more</em> pieces than all those, like padlock pieces that need to be \u201cunlocked\u201d before they can be cleared, but I\u2019ll stop there. You get the idea.</p>

aV<p>Setting gameplay aside, the rest of the package is pretty outstanding as well. The visuals remind me of a lighter <em>Puzzlejuice</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=457273926&amp;mt=8">$1.99</a>], with a flat, squared look that conveys everything in a simple and sleek way with no fuss. The music and sound effects also do a great job of setting the mood without distracting from the brilliant puzzling. There also seems to be a hint of a story weaved between some levels, with mysterious text appearing every so often.</p>
p7
aV<p>The game has two main modes, Regular (I\u2019m calling it that) and Challenge. Regular is split into normal difficulty and hard difficulty, and Challenge spans three pages of levels and is even more puzzle-y than the regular mode. There you\u2019ll be given a few pieces that need to be cleared in a limited number of moves, and most of the levels seem to require a very specific solution to solve them. It\u2019s a clever way to build on the core mechanics of the game, and I can see some people having even more fun there.</p>

aV<p>Most of us are pretty sick of match three games at this point, and it\u2019s safe to say it takes something pretty special to squeeze a glowing review out of the genre these days. <em>Swapperoo</em> by Fallen Tree Games is one such game. It\u2019s incredibly clever, deeply strategic, has an inviting visual style that begs to be interacted with, and is just plain <em>fun</em>. If you\u2019re one of the people <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=270258" target="_blank">I often see in our forums</a> asking for \u201cpremium\u201d match three games with no free-to-play shenanigans, welcome to your next addiction.</p>
