We spent a few years living in an apartment above it when I was a kid, and my first job was taking tickets at the box office. I still love going there when I visit my parents, even though I don\u2019t always stay to watch the shows (which only play on weekends, of course.) Movie theatres are familiar and comfortable to me, and spending most of my life around one instilled me with a deep love and appreciation of movies and filmmaking in general. The folks at Jamwix seem to feel exactly the same way, and it shows in their latest app, <em>CineMagic</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=901677841&amp;mt=8">Free</a>].</p>

Each level presents you with a screen full of little icons that need to be swiped, swapped, and matched to clear as many as possible before you run out of moves. Instead of candy, you\u2019ll mostly be dealing with fancy hats, typewriters, cameras, and other movie-making related objects.</p>

aV<p>Personally, I\u2019ve never been too enamored with match three games, though. Nothing against them--they\u2019re just not my jam. Luckily, <em>CineMagic</em> has a twist. (Not like a <em>Sixth Sense</em> or <em>Memento</em> twist, though. More like <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em>--a clever spin on well-worn territory.) Instead of just passing levels through matching, you\u2019ll also be creating original movies. Every movie is made up of seven elements, the game informs us: Two plots, two characters, two actors, and a location. Match enough typewriters, and you\u2019ll be able to add a plot to your movie. Match enough of the little blue houses, and you\u2019ve got a location.</p>

In part this is due to the game really going all in on the idea, and it\u2019s actually kind of surprising how deep the system goes. For example, you can\u2019t just toss any random actors into any plot you like; each element (they\u2019re called \u201ccinebits\u201d) is strong or weak in certain genres, and you have to be careful to make sure all the parts of your film fit together in a way that makes sense. If they don\u2019t, the critics will hate it and audiences won\u2019t pay to see it (which translates to a much lower score for you, of course).</p>

For example, I\u2019ve had Nicolas Cage play a stripper and Maggie Smith play a janitor. And they were coming of age while battling an evil wizard on a fishing boat. (Of course, in <em>CineMagic</em> their names have to be Nicked Rage and Aggie Sith, but still.) After each level the game presents you with a poster for your movie and a short article in a Variety-style rag summarizing your film and how it did against the competition, and it\u2019s all usually pretty absurd and hilarious. The game also includes a gallery in the menu with all your best (and worst) movies, so you can revisit the highs and lows of your career any time you like.</p>

aV<p>Another important aspect of the game is collecting the cinebits themselves. There are tons of plots (\u201cdefend outpost\u201d, \u201cunlikely lovers\u201d), stars (\u201cSadam Handler\u201d, \u201cZooey ByChanel\u201d), locations (\u201cdeserted mall\u201d, \u201cfuturistic metropolis\u201d), and roles (\u201cgrizzled cop\u201d, \u201cpregnant parent\u201d) that can all be used in your films once they\u2019re unlocked or bought with in-game currency. There are also special cinebits that enhance your movie overall, like \u201cepic dance sequence\u201d and \u201chit soundtrack\u201d. Each type can be upgraded to improve its stats and unlock more specific genres that help cinebits fit together (like \u201ccrime\u201d and \u201cindie\u201d) and it all goes a pretty long way to making the game feel almost infinitely replayable.</p>

aV<p>So far, I think I\u2019ve described a pretty awesome game. And it is, quite often. Unfortunately, it\u2019s also ever-so-slightly janky. The menus feel slow at times, the cloud saves don\u2019t seem to transfer everything from device to device (like currency and past movies in the gallery), and the \u201chint\u201d that shows potential matches doesn\u2019t seem to be aware when there\u2019s a window covering the board. On top of that there are a few puzzling design choices, like the fact that you can\u2019t exit out of certain windows (forcing you to make a choice with no option of canceling) and the fact that the aforementioned hint feature seems to have split personalities (sometimes flashing green on a match, and sometimes showing a cartoon hand pointing to matches) and can\u2019t be turned off. Also, the gallery lets you switch from seeing your best movies to seeing your worst ones, but you can\u2019t switch back.</p>

aV<p>There are tons of weird little quirks like that in <em>CineMagic</em> that make it feel like it maybe should have spent another month or two in the oven, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t fun to play. Over time you learn to navigate around all the weird little bugs and puzzling UI decisions and just enjoy the game for what it is: a surprisingly strategic movie generator wrapped around decent match-three mechanics with lots of charm and personality. Like a favorite but flawed movie, you can recognize all of its shortcomings while still appreciating it for the spark of life at its center. And anyway, the price of admission here is free, so why not grab a ticket?</p>
