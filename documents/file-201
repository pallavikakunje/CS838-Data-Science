It was the brainchild of a little known game designer by the name of Steven Spielberg (who also dabbles in film, I\u2019m told), and it was absurdly fun. There\u2019s something about huge explosions and large structures toppling over that delights the eight year old boy in me, and <em>Boom Blox</em> (and especially it\u2019s sequel, <em>Bash Party</em>) took over my free time for countless weeks. Ever since those days I\u2019ve been yearning for something like that on mobile, and while there have been a couple physics-based games that provide a similar feeling (my favorite being <em>Turbo Dismount</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=881155044&amp;mt=8">Free</a>]), none have quite captured the floaty, block-on-block destruction I\u2019ve craved since 2009. <em>[Dramatic pause.]</em> ...That is, until now.</p>

The physics are absolutely dead-on, and because of that it\u2019s an utter joy to play. Each level presents you with a structure (or two or three) made of different types of blocks (wood, stone, ice, etc.) and your job is simply to destroy it. To do that, you need to throw monkeys at it. Yes, monkeys. (Well, their heads, anyway.) Like the blocks, there are different flavors of monkeys, including explosive monkeys, heavy monkeys, and--my favorite--sticky monkeys. To pass a level you just need to hit a certain score threshold, which is achieved by having as many blocks as possible fall off the foundation. It\u2019s incredibly easy to grasp once you dive in, and part of what makes it work so well is how intuitive everything is.</p>

aV<p>Controlling the game is as simple as swiping and tapping. Swiping to swivel the level around or up and down to get a better view, and tapping to fire off a monkey. It\u2019s super simple, and I\u2019m glad the developer didn\u2019t try to ape (heh) the <em>Boom Blox</em> series <em>too</em> closely by using some kind of crazy accelerometer controls for throwing, since I have vivid memories of my right arm being incredibly sore the day after playing those games. (Also, I rather like my iPhone not being stuck halfway into the wall.)</p>

aV<p>Just mimicking the physics of a beloved Wii game isn\u2019t enough to make a great mobile experience, though. Thankfully, <em>Monkeyrama</em> absolutely nails the level design, with structures that range from pure explosive fun to surprisingly devious puzzles. For example, (spoilers?) there\u2019s a pirate ship later on that has three explosive blocks on stilts and you only have two throws to knock it all down. I spent literally 20 minutes trying in vain to destroy the damn thing, when I accidentally scrolled the screen up and noticed the secret: <em>larger</em> explosives high above that could easily be knocked onto the other blocks to obliterate everything. I literally laughed out loud when I realized how simple it was.</p>

aV<p>Everything in the game works so well, actually, that all of my complaints are things that <em>aren\u2019t</em> there, rather than problems with the things that are. For example, despite the fact that there are almost 90 different levels to complete, I finished all of them almost in one sitting. I suppose it\u2019s a good thing to leave your audience wanting more, but <em>Monkeyrama</em> accomplished that a little too well. (Of course, it\u2019s only 99 cents, and there are more levels supposedly on the way.) Another thing that pains me is that there\u2019s no level editor included, which was by far the best part of the <em>Boom Blox</em> series. I mean, I literally made a giant piano and a working Minesweeper board in <em>Bash Party</em>. And then blew them up over and over. More realistically, it\u2019d be great if there were replay options in <em>Monkeyrama</em>, like the ability to rewind the action and play it back at different speeds (like <em>Turbo Dismount</em>). Finally, it really sucks that there are no leaderboards. What the heck, Tuomas?</p>

aV<p>On paper, <em>Monkeyrama</em> doesn\u2019t seem particularly exciting. It\u2019s kind of hard to give a high rating to something that\u2019s basically a super stripped down version of a previous game about throwing balls at blocks. But you know what? It\u2019s only a buck, and it provides an experience that's absolutely perfect for large interactive screens like the iPad. Plus, it got more smiles-per-minute out of me than almost any other game I\u2019ve played this year. I\u2019m not sure what that says about me, and I don\u2019t care. I whole-hearted love this game. (Mic drop.)</p>
