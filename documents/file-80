p1
aV<p>I forgot smart, really fun, super challenging, and dangerously addictive \u2013 in the best way possible.</p>
p2
aV<p><em>868-HACK</em> is a rogue-like, where you \u2013 turn for turn, with your enemies \u2013 move about 8 cyber-sectors attempting to hack siphons. To be successful, you\u2019ll need abilities. To gain abilities, you\u2019ll need resources. Ultimately, strategic planning and decision making \u2013 move by move \u2013 will determine how long you\u2019ll survive and where your name will rest on the leaderboards.</p>
p3
aV<p>The layers that peel off the mechanics - once <em>868</em> has settle in - begin to reveal such a simple premise to be a complex onion. I began strategizing my steps instead of instinctively moving, because every step and choice matters. One misstep WILL mean \u201cgame over.\u201d</p>
p4
aV<p>This is one of the most challenging rogue-likes I\u2019ve ever played, and requires your time, patience, and gradual understanding to fully grasp. Give <em>868-HACK</em> that, though, and it becomes a glowing approach to a genre that often packs in more for gains, instead of simplifying without loss.</p>
p5
aV<p>With little to no description about what his game *really* is, an art direction that \u2013 to some \u2013 may be a bit TOO retro, and a risky asking price: Brough makes an important statement about what we expect our iOS gaming experiences to be. Not all touch games are unworthy gaming experiences.</p>

aV<p>After playing <em>868-HACK</em>, I was ecstatic with my purchase. The game is incredibly fun, unique, endlessly-playable, brilliantly designed, and worth way more than what it\u2019s asking for. Michael obviously poured godly amounts of time into designing this game; time that, in the end, pays off on the player's end.</p>
p8
aV<p>Brilliant game mechanics are rare these days. Even more so, are those mechanics that reveal underlying mechanics as you progressively get better at playing the game. Getting better at <em>868-HACK</em> is the carrot on the stick, and once you have had a small nibble you\u2019ll find yourself running, to the edge of the earth, for one more bite.</p>
p9
aV<p><em>868-HACK</em> is for everyone who loves to tell themselves, \u201cJust one more try\u201d, and realize 2 more hours have passed. It\u2019s that kind of gripping game experience that makes you forget all else exists at that moment. It\u2019s nothing flashy, just great mechanics and an excellent approach to simplified design that harkens back to the best classic arcade games. Reminds me how much more important great game mechanics are, and how badly we need more of it on the platform.</p>
