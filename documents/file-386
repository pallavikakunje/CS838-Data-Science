aV<p>While pigs don\u2019t exactly fly, their rubbery skins and rotund bodies do lend well to bouncing, and <em>Bubble Pig</em>\u2019s gameplay takes full advantage of this. Bouncing the pig around each level is easy; all you have to do is tap where you\u2019d like the pig to bounce to, and he\u2019ll continue to bounce automatically in that direction.</p>

aV<p>One-touch controls can feel too simplistic if not done well, but this game manages to do it without making it feel like an effortless experience. As some of our <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?threadid=131615">forum posters</a> have pointed out, the gameplay is remarkably similar to <em><a href="http://toucharcade.com/2011/07/21/beans-quest-review-a-fun-five-minutes/">Bean\u2019s Quest</a> </em>[<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=449069244&amp;mt=8">$2.99</a>] or <em>Superstar Chefs </em>[<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=356175855&amp;mt=8">$0.99</a>].</p>

aV<p>Making the pig bounce all around the level may be fun, but you will need to complete goals along the way to keep things moving smoothly. Using the pig, you\u2019ll need to activate switches scattered throughout each stage, with the level completing once you\u2019ve hit them all. What makes the stages fun isn\u2019t just moving around and hitting the switches however, the gimmicks involved in each stage are.</p>
p5
aV<p>Just about every level has a unique gimmick you\u2019ll need to overcome, keeping things fresh each time you play. In one level, you may need to dodge angry foxes that threaten to slaughter your poor pig, or perhaps you\u2019ll need to navigate a series of pipes to find all of the switches in another. Having a new type of concept introduced in almost each new level will keep you thirsty for more and more every time you pick up the game.</p>

aV<p>Also scattered through each level are various fruits and coins for you to collect. Collecting these items (especially all of them if you can) will reward you with achievements and a special star rating for each level. To further incentivize collecting, you can also compare scores with your friends to make sure you\u2019re as hot as you think you are. Sharing and comparing is key for longevity in these types of games, so it\u2019s nice to see the leaderboards and achievements integrated so tightly.</p>

aV<p>We\u2019ve probably all come to expect by now that Donut has a unique style that every one of their games uses, and <em>Bubble Pig</em> is no exception. Each stage is colorful and the animations are incredibly smooth, keeping with the standards already set. Being a universal app also helps, as playing on the iPad makes controlling the pig a bit easier, and the colors pop just a bit more.</p>
p9
aV<p><em>Bubble Pig</em> is one of those games that achieves a great balance between being straightforward, while still managing to be challenging too. Dismissing the game as being too formulaic would be unfair, as it manages to be very fun despite its simplistic premise.</p>
