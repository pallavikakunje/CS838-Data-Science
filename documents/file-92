This undeniably is the most ambitious iOS game I\u2019ve ever played, showing off AAA production value at every turn. And more surprising, that\u2019s not entirely the reason I LOVE <em>Republique</em>, instead finding the little-touches this game\u2019s most endearing quality.</p>

aV<p>\u2018Exordium\u2019, the first of 5 chapters- to this episodic stealth-action thriller, does not disappoint. It starts with a female protagonist named Hope, who is held captive within an oppressive totalitarian compound, in the age of the internets and government surveillance. And then there are you: the player acting hacker, who is desperately called upon by Hope to help her escape the captors. The story slowly begins to unfold from there \u2013 for lack of spoilers \u2013 and does so wonderfully, and mainly through means of gameplay. Know this: <em>Republique</em>\u2019s cast of excellently acted and all-star voiced characters are likable, in their own way \u2013 one of my favorite being the hilarious text-to-speech Cooper.</p>

aV<p>Yes, I said \u2018text-to-speech!\u2019</p>
p4
aV<p>Who, what, when, and why are revealed through exploring this beautifully rendered compound, across emails, voice-mail, notes, tapes, you name it. These are a delightful reward to gain from simply sneaking around these intriguing walls. Most of <em>Republique</em>\u2019s notes are to be taken serious, but there are also literal laugh-out-loud moments to be had, which is nice. I continued to explore because I cared to know more about this world Camouflaj has clearly taken so much time to flesh-out. I was not disappointed that I did, and found discovering plot-points to be much more engaging than having it spoon fed.</p>
p5
aV<p><em>Republique</em> plays entirely one-touch \u2013 aside from a pinch-to-zoom function \u2013 and does so gracefully, as a stealth game. Much of its gameplay consists of directing Hope by tapping on location, while also tap-hacking your way from camera to camera, using OMNI-view, to see what\u2019s around the bend.  I never felt like I needed a controller, nor wanted one. Republique controls beautifully as a touch game, and makes more sense, as so, when in regards to its narrative.</p>

aV<p>The game\u2019s hack, hide, and run, as stealth-action games are expected. As you progress through the chapter, upgraded  OMNI-hacks become available - allowing for more strategic options to evading or nullifying patrolling enemies. While on the subject of enemies, I should note that <em>Republique</em>\u2019s keeps with tradition and mostly follow a looped patrol-path. Don\u2019t expect dynamic AI all around, but rather AI that does a damn fine job of chasing you down if you are spotted. Regardless, the games stealth-scenarios are always fun to overcome, thanks to the games interesting control mechanics and keen design.</p>
p8
aV<p><em>Republique</em> ran me 5 hours, finishing with a 68% completion ranking and a Play+ option to go back and gather what I missed. I instantly went back to start gathering. The best one-thing this game does is collectables, allowing all \u2013 of which there are plenty \u2013 of them to have purpose, personality, and heart.</p>

aV<p>For example: Hope can pickpocket patrolling enemies to take back Cooper\u2019s stolen games, which is one of many collectables <em>Republique</em> has to offer. The cool-thing about this collectable is\u2026 they\u2019re actually other great iOS games dressed as Atari carts. For collecting these, you get to hear Cooper explain why you should buy these OTHER iOS games, in the most charming of ways. Bravo, Camouflaj, that\u2019s the nicest thing I\u2019ve ever seen a game do for others and really expresses the personalities behind the game; and you can never have enough personality in any game.</p>
p11
aV<p>Technically, the game played smoothly on my iPad 2 and iPhone 4S, with the exceptional \u2018chug\u2019 for saving or loading. As usual, I found the tablet provides a better experience due to screen real-estate, but it\u2019s totally playable on the smaller. Otherwise, a single crash back to the OS is all I have for technical gripes.</p>

aV<p>In fact, I didn\u2019t find much to complain about while playing thru \u2018Exordium\u2019. At one point I desired a mini-map \u2013 which <em>Republique</em> does not have \u2013 only to later realize that I never *really* needed it and found its absence to drive exploration. I guess if I had one complaint it is <em>Republique</em>\u2019s lack of an objective list, maybe? I didn\u2019t really need one, but others may? The fact that I\u2019m not complaining about eye-poking IAPs is precedent enough.</p>
p14
aV<p><em>Republique</em> is risky. It\u2019s a big budget stealth-action epic on iOS that is attempting to change the face of touch games forever. And it should\u2026 <em>Republique</em> is shaping up to be a masterpiece. Sure, there are more chapters to come, but based on what I\u2019ve seen so far\u2026 faith is running high. For those of you who\u2019ve complained about the state of \u2018core\u2019 or \u2018console-like\u2019 experiences on iOS \u2013 outside of ported games \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t hesitate to throw your moneys at Camouflaj. They deserve it. Exciting, fun, polished, and perfectly fit for the platform, <em>Republique</em> is showing me nothing but promise. Promise I\u2019m already convinced they\u2019re going to keep.</p>
