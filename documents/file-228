Sure, there\u2019s a lot more garbage than gold, but that\u2019s what Touch Arcade\u2019s here for: to dip our proverbial pan into Apple Creek and shake it around until we see something shiny. And friends, I may have just struck it rich.</p>

Your goal is to get to the end of each level alive, where a crystal portal will whisk you away to the next one. However, since you are limited to only jumping, you need to make use of a series of rolling platforms to get anywhere.</p>

aV<p>Mechanically, it kinda reminds me a bit of those mine cart levels in <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>. Each time you land on one of the rolling platforms, it automatically scoots forward at a fixed speed. It\u2019s a rather ingenious way to get around the problem most platformers on iOS face: how do you make a game easy to control without real buttons? Effectively, <em>WonderCat</em> gets around this by turning the entire screen into a single button. It\u2019s certainly not the first time we\u2019ve something like this (the word \u201cauto-runner\u201d comes to mind) but the way it utilizes jumping and rolling platforms in every stage still feels clever and fresh.</p>

It\u2019s relentlessly gorgeous, and the developers aren\u2019t afraid to flaunt it (the only other button on the screen besides pause is a camera icon to share a screenshot). The game takes you from crystal mines to clouds in the sky to the insides of a fiery volcano, and I couldn\u2019t stop marveling at how great everything looked. The main character in his little yellow robo-suit looks awesome as well: equal parts adorable and bad-ass. I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s possible, but if anyone could do it, it\u2019d be a cat.</p>

aV<p>It took me a few days to complete the game, but if you were dedicated you could probably do it in an afternoon. I found the difficulty to be absolutely perfect, with more challenging stages almost always being shorter so they never got frustrating. In fact, the length of the game (as well as the length of each stage) and the difficulty level are all perfectly balanced throughout, and the only thing I had trouble with was putting the game down once I completed each stage. Once you do finish the game, you can go back and essentially \u201cthree star\u201d each level by trying to collect all of the crystals. Sometimes that means taking a different path through each stage, so you\u2019ll even be getting a slightly different experience.</p>

aV<p>The crystals you collect are only for the completionists out there (and leaderboard chasers), which means there\u2019s no shop with upgrades or new suits or anything. I\u2019m the kind of guy that absolutely loves all that crap, but I didn\u2019t miss it in this game. There\u2019s something kind of refreshingly oldschool about a game that\u2019s 100% designed to be played all the way through with the same exact skills you start with. That being said, if they ever did a sequel or added new levels, I certainly wouldn\u2019t object to more variety in abilities, characters, or suits. (In particular, a hook mechanic would be awesome in this game--but that\u2019s just me dreamin\u2019.)</p>

aV<p><em>WonderCat Adventures</em> dropped at a weird time of the week from an unknown developer (whose name sounds like something you\u2019d search for on a sketchy torrent site), but don\u2019t let any of that stop you from checking out this little gem. It\u2019s a platformer that knows exactly what platform it\u2019s on, and rolls with it. One-touch controls, bite-sized levels, perfect difficulty curve, and a visual style that looks amazing on a high resolution screen. I can\u2019t wait to see what this weird little cat does next.</p>
