Developers and series will pop up, and if they hang around, you can see what they do to build on what they did before to try to make an even better game. Sometimes it works out, and sometimes it doesn't. In the case of developer TouchMint and its <em>Adventure To Fate</em> series of turn-based RPGs, it's happily been the former. When the first game launched almost two years ago, it was a fun, somewhat rough game that got better with a couple of updates. Last year, a free-to-play follow-up came out, focusing almost entirely on the combat system and character development mechanics. That game, too, got some really nice updates that made the game better. I don't know what the update plans look like for <em>Adventure To Fate: Quest To The Future</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1060178390&amp;mt=8">$3.99</a>] looks like, but even in its present state, it shows the experience TouchMint has gathered in its own personal quest for glory.</p>

aV<p>In the broad strokes, <em>Quest To The Future</em> is fairly similar to the first game, <em>Quest To The Core</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=871690289&amp;mt=8">$2.99</a>]. Dungeon exploration makes its return here after being cut from the second game, while all of the combat and gear mechanics that were added to the sequel are obviously present here. A few things have been streamlined. Notably, you can no longer select your character's race separately from their class during character creation. You simply choose a class or race from a selection of six. Once you've done that, you'll be given some story exposition and dropped into a safe area where you can buy gear, heal, and so on. The door to the first dungeon of five in total is sitting right in front of you, so you can head on in and get ready to fight.</p>

aV<p>For the most part, the dungeon crawling aspect of the game isn't terribly different from the first game. Small tweaks have made it better, but the strength of <em>Adventure To Fate</em> is as it always has been: a solid, tactical, turn-based battle system that gives you lots of options for how to approach each combat. The skills you carry into battle with you are determined by your class and level, and you'll eventually reach a point where you'll have more skills than open battle slots, so you'll have to consider which ones you'll need to equip for the fights that are coming up. Equipment can also have a variety of special effects attached to it, so it makes sense to keep a few different ones around for certain areas. Your inventory is limited, however, so you can't bring too much with you. Also as before, you have to equip potions to your belt to use them in battle, so even if you've filled your pack with health restores, you can't just chug your way to victory.</p>

aV<p>As with the previous game, there's a ton of loot in <em>Adventure To Fate: Quest To The Future</em>. Your character has equipment slots for just about every part of their body, and there are a bunch of pieces, regular and magical, for each slot. The best gear in the game is again reserved for the crafting system. When you roll your character, you'll choose from one of six different crafting professions, each with access to certain types of gear. Since you can't change your profession, the only way to get all of the gear in the game is to play through with multiple characters. After clearing the game once, you'll gain access to a special lockbox that will allow you to move items between different characters. You'll also unlock a special arena that lets you face off against just about every enemy that has ever appeared in this series.</p>

aV<p>Outside of the UI and monetization system, the presentation of the game hasn't changed greatly. There are a few good chiptunes to play along to, and the visuals lean heavily on the decent-but-overused Oryx sprite set. This time around, the game draws from a different set of Oryx sprites than the previous games, at least. You probably won't have seen many of these sprites in other games, even if the style is very familiar. The various backgrounds are pretty cool and do their best to set up the time-spanning story. They basically have to do that job on their own, because you won't get much story beyond the initial push.</p>

aV<p>Make no bones about it, <em>Adventure To Fate: Quest To The Future</em> is an RPG for those who are looking primarily for an enjoyable, yet familiar, battle experience. The exploration aspects are okay but not particularly exciting, and the story is barely there. When it comes to messing around with your character's parameters and having some good old-fashioned turn-based fun, that's where <em>Adventure To Fate</em> has you well-covered. This particular taste of comfort food isn't going to be for everyone, and the series is at risk of repeating itself perhaps a little too much at this point, but <em>Quest To The Future</em> is ultimately worth picking up for fans of battle-heavy RPGs.</p>
