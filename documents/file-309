No chance. It may as well be called <em>EDM: The Game</em>, packed with visceral, beat-dropping music and intense, glowing visuals. It\u2019s video-game-as-album, with tracks and verses instead of stages. I happen to love both EDM and video games. And I love <em>Dropchord</em>.</p>

aV<p>Gameplay starts simply, as players touch two points in a big circle, and a beam connecting the points collects notes and avoids red scratches. Soon it gets fast and fierce, and new mechanics are introduced. Collecting notes increases the score multiplier, but hitting the scratches lowers health, ending the party prematurely. New mechanics crop up, like swiping to spin the beam around the circle or tapping smaller circles with one or two fingers.</p>
p2
aV<p>It looks like a music visualizer come to life. Lights pulsate to the rhythm. Tracks turn tougher as the beat pounds, and the finger gymnastics get elaborate. Twitchy as it may be, a fair amount of strategy is required to master, or even pass, some of the tougher tracks. It takes skill and speed to weave and bob around the circle, scoring as much as possible without overreaching. For wimps like me, it\u2019s almost too hard.</p>

aV<p>It\u2019s a short game. Every track, played perfectly from beginning to end without losing once (which won\u2019t happen) is under 45 minutes. But who cares? It\u2019s not bloated. Every second of <em>Dropchord</em> is a thrill, with tons of variation in color and sound without sacrificing consistency in tone, from the second the app opens and the beam is first connected.</p>
p5
aV<p>\u201cFull Mix\u201d puts the game on shuffle, as random verses from random tracks play, increasing in difficulty. There\u2019s also a way to skip tracks in the standard mode, by pausing the game and skipping to the next track, but it\u2019s clunky and takes way too long. Track selection from level one, along with titles, would have been welcome.</p>
p6
aV<p>Some will play <em>Dropchord</em> to chase a high score. Frankly I don\u2019t think I could care less about the score, or even surviving. I just wanted to play. There should be simple track selection and a free play mode. I never thought I\u2019d say this, but I would have given <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=james+murphy&amp;oq=james+murphy&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i57j5j0l2.2413j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=5f8a9dc5dc89834&amp;q=james+murphy&amp;safe=off">James Murphy\u2019s</a> best suit (not that I\u2019ve stolen his suit) for a demo mode.</p>

aV<p>I just wanted to plug my iPhone into a sound system and monitor and let <em>Dropchord</em> show me some pretty sounds and lights. (The soundtrack is available on <a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/album/dropchord/id669704480">iTunes</a>, so I can complete half of the equation.) These are very easy fixes, and don\u2019t devalue an electrifying game.</p>
p9
aV<p>Some games make me want to keep playing all night long, sucking hour after hour until the sun comes up. <em>Dropchord</em> makes me want to throw down my iPhone and dance till dawn. But that would mean I\u2019d have to stop playing. It's a nice dilemma.</p>
