aV<p>I missed out on the 2004 original that this version is based on, so you\u2019ll have to excuse my fawning. From what I gather, this is a pretty close translation. What is different is its new, much more flat look and the implementation of touch, which works well enough, but also tends to feel imprecise and unresponsive when the action gets hot.</p>

It\u2019s a boring hunk of narrative to begin with, and it\u2019s also one that comes off as disingenuous. All the threads of story that nap while travelling courtesy of your \u201cRescue Your Family\u201d map are just cold, mechanical excuses to partake in sub-games like, for example, the oft-used \u201cconstruct a another map by killing evil barons\u201d sub-game.</p>

aV<p>As odd as it sounds, the core of <em>Pirates</em> resides outside of this goal. In equal parts, you\u2019ll be able to try to find your family members and seek fame and fortune. In the process, you\u2019ll spend a lot of time bombarding and pillaging cities, pillaging galleons, pillaging people, and dancing with governors\u2019 daughters until your lad morphs into a toothless old man and is forced to retire from his swashbuckling days.</p>

It\u2019s hard to get a real sense of this landscape the first time through the game, though, which indicates a larger problem that most simulation games share: <em>Pirates</em> isn\u2019t good at telling you what's going on in the background and it\u2019s doubly-bad at sharing how to play and succeed in a world that changes and hinges on you and AI interaction.</p>

aV<p>If my take on <em>Pirates</em> sounds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club_(novel)">Project Mayhem</a>-y to you, it\u2019s because this is how I choose to view and roll in the world. While the simulation and simplicity of <em>Pirates</em> are two great aspects of a coherent whole, the fact that you can just be a pirate and do your own thing is welcome. <em>Pirates</em> has a deceiving open-ended nature.</p>

aV<p>Let\u2019s dig in a little bit. A vertical slice of the game would look a little something like this: you\u2019re in charge of 20 men on a scoop, which is a fast and lightweight boat. As you travel along the coast you\u2019ll see cities, all of which give you the option to enter or bombard. You\u2019ll also see boats rumbling here or there and you can attack them one-by-one.</p>

It\u2019s man-on-man, the goal being to take the other ship. Depending on the amount of cannons you have, you can choose to either put your boat in a good position to destroy the opponents with metal or you can just ram into it and force an on-board battle. The number of dudes you have in the boat matters, but so do your sword skills. There\u2019s a mini-game that lets you take on the captain of this boat in a swipe-based free-for-all where you pick high, low, or medium attacks or counters versus his own. If you kill him, the boat is yours and so are his goods, which you can sell at other ports for money.</p>

aV<p>What you won\u2019t see in this slice are the other things: your men expect to earn gold and if you don\u2019t eventually earn enough and break up your pirate party, they\u2019ll mutiny. Also, you need to buy food to make sure they don\u2019t die as you travel to destinations, which you can either (a) sack or (b) visit the governor and receive new titles that boost your fame meter and give you a larger cut whenever you do break up the party. You also wouldn't see me buying special items to increase my skills, assembling treasure maps, stealthing, killing the Top 10 pirates, discovering hidden locations, escorting royalty, and much, much more.</p>

Most are super simple and have endlessly repeating cut-scenes and transitions that come across as, generally, as pretty cheesy. Despite this, I\u2019ve yet to tire of the tasks set before me: they\u2019re breezy, for one, and they also feed into the \u201cone more time\u201d mentality that keeps you up late with other games of this ilk.</p>

aV<p>While there are some simulation blues -- feeling that countdown timer on your youth is a bit depressing and travelling without wind at your back chips away at that like none other -- there is a lot to like about <em>Pirates</em>. It\u2019s deceptively deep, riddled with charming animations, colors, and characters, and offers a huge bag of things to do. It also runs well enough and is tuned well enough to recommend it on the iPad, which obviously is a huge plus. I like it, but I admit that it\u2019s probably for all the wrong reasons.</p>

aV<p>Now, excuse me while I sail up and down the world in service of Dutch dominance just so I can re-sack the towns for the Spanish. Ahoy!</p>
