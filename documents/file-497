I don\u2019t know why, but it is. Many of my favorite games on the App Store use some kind of swinging as a mechanic, from <em>Hanger World</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=986709487&amp;mt=8">Free</a>] and <em>Mikey Hooks</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=590500000&amp;mt=8">$1.99</a>] to the long forgotten <em>Rock Runners</em> and <em>Slingshot Racing</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=516349924&amp;mt=8">$0.99</a>]. In preparation for this review I did a brief Google search to figure out what is so satisfying about swinging, but all I found were adult advice columns. (Some iOS games call it "hooking"; maybe I should have searched for that instead?) Perhaps it\u2019s so fun because our ancestors lived in trees, or because it hits some perfect combination of speed and weightlessness. Who knows! Developer Small Giant\u2019s latest game <em>Rope Racers</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1047610405&amp;mt=8">Free</a>] is all about swinging, and it pretty much nails that sensation.</p>

aV<p>I really like the way the swinging feels. Each time you tap the screen, a rope extends from your character at a 45 degree angle, and it attaches to the first obstacle it touches. Each level is designed with a pretty good mix of wide open spaces and platforms to hook on to, and when you get into the zone and have a lot of momentum behind you it can feel really, really good. Especially when you win first place.</p>

aV<p>So yeah, it\u2019s not just swinging. It\u2019s also racing. Each level has nine other people with you, and you\u2019re all trying to finish three or four laps in the fastest time possible. That\u2019s a bit misleading, though, as it\u2019s actually their <em>ghosts</em> that you\u2019re racing (as far as I can tell). I\u2019m glad they made that choice for two reasons: No waiting around for matchmaking, and no collision detection when you hit another player. It\u2019s very streamlined as it is now, and hopping from race to race is about as quick and frictionless as possible.</p>

aV<p>The worst of the free-to-play stuff, in my opinion, is the stamina timer. You can do 15 career races before it runs out, which sounds like a lot, but really isn\u2019t since most races take about 30 seconds. I actually timed it once, and it took me about 10 minutes to blow through all my stamina in one go. For many free-to-play games (like city builders and what-have-you) having a 10 minute session isn\u2019t bad, and in fact could even be considered long. But the thing is, the gameplay in <em>Rope Racers</em> is <em>really awesome</em> and I can\u2019t help but feel disappointed each time I\u2019m forced to toss it aside. (Of course, I've managed to make it quite far in the game over the past week or so despite the 10-15 sessions, so maybe it's good the stamina timer's there so you can't blow through the whole game in two days.)</p>

aV<p>Luckily, the dual currency system in general isn\u2019t particularly problematic. You get coins and bucks for racing and completing various goals, and they tend to flow fairly liberally all things considered. I never really felt like I had to grind to upgrade a character or buy a new one, and the payouts for winning races later in the game go up quite substantially. (I'm in the Sapphire League currently, where you get $130,000 for winning first place. The Beginner League, by comparison, awards a mere $100.) Maybe the currency system is so generous to offset how mildly frustrating some of the other parts are? Who knows.</p>

aV<p>Despite those complaints, though, at the end of the day it\u2019s still a super fun little game. The rope swinging feels great and the racing is fast and fair. (Well, you can use a speed boost every few hours if you watch an ad, but you\u2019re not actually racing in real time so that doesn't bug me too much.) Still, even though I get excited when I check in and find that my stamina is full, I can\u2019t help but wish it wasn\u2019t there at all (or lasted longer, or refilled faster) so I could enjoy the game in longer sessions. That\u2019s just the reality of the current market, though, so really I should just be thankful I can play the game at all, right? Besides, I can always go back to <em>Train Conductor World</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=932228293&amp;mt=8">Free</a>] while I wait.</p>
