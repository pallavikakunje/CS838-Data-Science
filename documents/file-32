Of course you do. It was probably one of the first games you put on your iPhone back in the day. It had some smooth 3D visuals and fun quick-reaction type gameplay that was a perfect fit for mobile. Well, flash forward five or six years and the New Hotness in town is a little game by Flippfly called <em>Race the Sun</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=700227648&amp;mt=8">$4.99</a>], which is\u2026 well, it\u2019s pretty much the same thing. So why is everyone getting so excited about it?</p>

(In fact, that\u2019s literally my job.) But first, let me explain what it is. In <em>Race the Sun</em> you play as a sleek little spaceship flying through a completely flat landscape with a bunch of random geometric objects strewn about. You need to tap the left and right sides of the screen to fly between them, or else you\u2019ll be turned into a glowing puff of smoke faster than you can blink. (Pro tip: Don\u2019t blink.) So far, so <em>Cube Runner</em>, right?</p>

aV<p>Well, not quite. But there isn\u2019t really one major thing that sets <em>Race</em> apart from <em>Cube</em>; rather, it\u2019s a dozen smaller things. The controls feel better. The speeds are faster. The environments are more varied and interesting. There are ramps that send you flying through the air, portals that whisk you into other dimensions, and great big shadows that sap your fuel. Plus, the levels change to something new every single day so you\u2019ll never get bored. It\u2019s really brilliant how it all comes together, and it\u2019s a total blast.</p>

First of all there\u2019s a three tiered mission system like <em>Jetpack Joyride</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=457446957&amp;mt=8">Free</a>]. It\u2019s my favorite kind, too: the kind where you don\u2019t have to finish all three in order to get new ones. It means that even if you get stuck on one (which you will, because that third tier can be a nightmare) you can still complete the easier ones and get new missions. These missions are of the typical variety where you must do X a certain number of times in one run or do Y over a series of runs. You get points for completing each one, and those points go toward leveling up.</p>

(Kind of a random question, but I\u2019m glad you asked!) Just about every time you level up you\u2019ll unlock something new and fun, like new power-ups or even new environments. Most interestingly, you can also unlock new attachments for your ship that give you passive abilities, like a magnet to suck in pickups from farther away or a battery so your ship will last longer. You can only have one at a time (at first), though, so you can pick a favorite and use that or keep switching among them based on whatever mission you\u2019re tackling. It adds a tiny bit more depth to a game that\u2019s otherwise just about swerving away from things at high speeds.</p>

aV<p>But oh, how much fun that swerving is. Even if the game didn\u2019t have all that extra junk I spent the last few paragraphs going on about, it would still be an amazing, exhilarating ride. Words cannot express how insanely fun it is to fly through a narrow corridor like a bullet from a gun, soar off a ramp into a series of score multipliers, barely miss a giant windmill\u2019s blades, and then get a \u201cPERFECT REGION\u201d message as you prepare to do it all again in the next area. Wait, didn\u2019t I just use words to express all of that? Anyway, the takeaway here is that the game is super fun.</p>

aV<p>In a way, this could be viewed as the App Store coming full circle. <em>Cube Runner</em> was among the first games to ever grace iPhones, and now, seven years later, here\u2019s <em>Race the Sun</em>. (<a href="http://toucharcade.com/2015/07/29/the-carter-crater-race-the-sun/" target="_blank">Ported over from Steam, but whatever.</a>) It\u2019s faster, weirder, prettier, and has way more to do. It\u2019s also more expensive, but that\u2019s okay. Those five dollars will be nothing more than a distant memory once you strap in and experience the rush for yourself.</p>
