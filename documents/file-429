After playing with the final product, I don\u2019t think I could come up with a more apt description.<em> Kickin Momma</em> centers around a similar type of Pachinko-like ball-bouncing gameplay that PopCap\u2019s title employs, and it does a great job at capturing the same kind of fun factor. It does add a few minor twists to the formula though, and finishes things off with its own brand of wackiness and top-notch production values.</p>

aV<p>The story follows a blue pear-shaped character named Momma, who has her sights set on an expensive jewel necklace. The problem is, she just can\u2019t afford it. Not content to live without this prized possession, she solemnly lumbers over to the edge of a cliff, possibly to leap off and end her suffering from desire. Then, after kicking a rock over the edge, she discovers the canyon is littered with bright pegs and fantastic jewels just like the ones from her coveted necklace. Suddenly it hits her \u2013 she can take her babies and kick them one by one into the canyon to collect the jewels for her. Sounds like a logical solution to me!</p>

aV<p>The absurdity of the premise for <em>Kickin Momma</em> is actually a large part of its appeal. It may sound horribly immoral, but before you run off calling Child Protective Services, keep in mind that Momma is a big ol\u2019 alien (er, uh, <em>something</em>), and the children seem to rather enjoy their bouncy journey to the bottom of the canyon, and always come out unscathed. So, you know, everybody wins in this scenario. So relax, tee up a baby, and punt your way towards riches.</p>
p4
aV<p>There are 36 levels in <em>Kickin Momma</em> spread out over 3 different worlds, with a spot for a 4th world hinted at for a future update. You begin a level from the left of the play field, where you will set the trajectory of your kick using a handy arrow guide. Touching and dragging will stretch and point the guide wherever you want it to go, and a set of arrows surrounding a \u201ckick\u201d button give you the ability to have more incremental movements if you need to be more precise.</p>

There are 10 red jewels in each level, and the main goal is always to knock them down from the play area to the ground where they are collected, with a minimum number needing to be collected to pass each level. Beyond that, you can also score big by triggering bonuses for lengthy bounces, hitting special blocks, or nailing enough pegs in a single turn to fill up an \u201con fire\u201d type of meter. Your total score for each level will determine whether you earn a bronze, silver, or gold medal.</p>

aV<p><em>Kickin Momma</em>\u2019s gameplay is largely based around luck. You\u2019ll aim your shot, kick a baby, and watch as it pinballs around the playing field, hopefully racking up enough points and jewels to advance to the next level. But, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s completely devoid of strategy. You\u2019re given a tiny window in the upper corner that gives you a close up view of your guide arrow\u2019s tip. Success often lies in placing the guide at just the right position to bounce off a peg, nab a jewel you need, or earn some bonuses for a big score. It can take some good decision making and skill to collect enough jewels to pass a level, let alone earn a score good enough to net a gold medal.</p>
p7
aV<p>As you progress, additional elements are added into the gameplay like different types of pegs, bombs, characters, and other items that keep things fresh. One of the highlights of <em>Kickin Momma</em> is the crazy art style and over-the-top effects that are constantly blasting all over the screen. Momma is known to bust crazy dance maneuvers while her babies are bouncing around, and typically her antics are pretty hilarious. You can also unlock several items to customize Momma with, like a mustache, boots, and a monocle. That\u2019s right, Momma got a \u2018stache. I told you this game is weird.</p>

aV<p>Depending on the your score in each turn, you are also treated to various fireworks, particle effects, and so much confetti you might think Rip Taylor was on the game design team. In general, this is what I like most about <em>Kickin Momma</em>. The gameplay isn\u2019t the deepest, but it\u2019s always fun, and who doesn\u2019t love watching a ton of shiny effects bursting right before their eyes while a giant blue alien thing does the worm off to the side?</p>
p10
aV<p><em>Kickin Momma </em>comes with enough levels to keep you busy for some time, especially if you go back to earn a gold medal on each one. Plus, there\u2019s Game Center achievements and leaderboards that increase the replay value even further. It comes in 2 flavors \u2013 a standard definition version designed for older devices, and a universal HD version for the iPad or Retina Display devices. If you enjoyed the somewhat crazy, random, arcade-style of <em>Peggle</em>\u2019s gameplay, then you will likely enjoy <em>Kickin Momma</em> as well, just as <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=102675">players in our forums</a> currently are.</p>
