This year has been a little more quiet on that front, with only a few offerings of any note at all. The best of this year's bunch until now has been <em>Lamp And Vamp</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=935215211&amp;mt=8">$1.99</a>] which, while very fun, was riffing pretty closely on <em>Hoplite</em>. Well, mark it on your calendars, friends, because I think we've got our first fresh hit of 2015 in the genre with <em>Auro</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=912559144&amp;mt=8">$1.99</a>], the latest game from the developers behind <em>100 Rogues</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=354011870&amp;mt=8">$2.99</a>]. This one's been cooking at Dinofarm Games for quite a long time now, but I think it's certainly worth the wait.</p>

aV<p>It's tempting to compare <em>Auro</em> to <em>Hoplite</em>, and I'm certainly going to be drawing lines between certain mechanics in this review, but in truth it's a very different game. Yes, it's a turn-based game that plays out on hex-based stages, but the overall goal is quite different. Instead of simply trying to make your way to each exit as safely as possible, you need to go on the offensive in <em>Auro</em>. Each round has you working towards a particular overall score, with points awarded for defeating the enemies that litter each stage. Stronger enemies cough up more points, but you'll have to work hard to earn them. Racking up kill combos will yield even more points, encouraging you to engage the enemy rather than play a stick and move game. There are incentives for making your way to the exit of each stage, however. You'll regain a little health, receive a new spell, and perhaps most importantly, get a fresh stage with a new batch of monsters to trash.</p>

aV<p>Aside from your bumping abilities, you also have access to a range of magic spells. Grouped into three different elements, these nine spells offer a wide range of effects. While one of them is a direct damage attack, the rest require a bit more strategy in their use. You can use a wind-assisted burst of speed to close the gap between you and a distant enemy, a bit of ice to make the ground beneath the enemy's feet so slippery than even a heavy opponent will lose their footing, or some fire magic to detonate a space, blowing back any enemies adjacent to it. You'll start off each game with a couple of these spells in tow, and you'll earn one more each time you exit a stage, up to a maximum of five. Each spell has a cool down associated with it, so you can't just use them willy-nilly. You can also pick up magic in the form of single-use candies. You can only carry two of these at any one time, but they can be very useful for giving you access to spells you don't have, or for an immediate extra shot of one you do.</p>

aV<p><em>Auro</em> has just the right mix going on with its gameplay elements. There are enough variables that new situations pop up constantly, but not so many that you can't easily learn the rules of each of them within a game or two. Having an overall level that has a tangible effect on gameplay gives you an over-arching meta-goal, helping tie together the enjoyment of each individual play session. I also love the way the game puts you on the attack. It lends<em> Auro</em> a very distinct feeling from games it shares a surface similarity with. It feels very good to bait enemies into just the right place and launch a couple of spells that send the lot of them into the drink.</p>

aV<p>I've only got a few criticisms of the game overall, and only one of them has anything to do with the play mechanics. I feel like the early game could ramp up just a little bit faster. When I played the test stage, I was still learning the game, so I got stuck on the easiest difficulty. Within a few games, I had figured quite a bit out and was eager to move on to stronger challenges, but the difficulty progression lagged a bit behind the development of my skill. If you like to play in landscape mode, you're out of luck, as <em>Auro</em> only works in portrait. I prefer portrait for this kind of game, but I know some people like it the other way, and it's always best to have options. Finally, this game doesn't respect the mute switch, which is a real pet peeve of mine. This is the perfect kind of game to fire up in bed after my wife has fallen asleep, but I hate having to dive for the volume buttons every single time.</p>

aV<p>Those little nitpicks aside, <em>Auro</em> is an excellent game. It uses familiar trappings but creates an entirely different experience on top of them. You're rewarded for being clever, creative, and aggressive, and thanks to the scaling difficulty, there's always a new challenge around the corner. As a cherry on top, the presentation is just as polished here as it was in <em>100 Rogues</em>. The graphics are adorable, the writing is cheeky, and the music is varied and catchy. <em>Auro</em> is one of the rare games in this genre that should please both beginners and experts alike. It's definitely worth checking out.</p>
