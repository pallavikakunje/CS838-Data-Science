And let\u2019s face it: if it didn\u2019t have the painting gimmick of the latter, the game would probably be little more than a clone of the former. In my mind, though, I can\u2019t help but see the 1998 film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120789/" target="_blank"><em>Pleasantville</em></a>. It depicted a black and white town from a fictional 1950\u2019s TV show, and how the characters (and town) slowly begin turning multicolored as they are introduced to the messy, complicated joys of real life for the first time. Certainly going on a high-speed chase would have counted, right?</p>

It\u2019s just fun to pretend I\u2019m enlightening all the little black and white towns with my rebellious high-speed joyrides through blocky suburbia rather than what I\u2019m really doing: dumping hundreds of gallons of paint on the street and causing thousands of dollars in property damage while trying to get away from the cops and (most likely) a lengthy jail sentence.</p>

aV<p>Anyway, if you\u2019re picturing the aforementioned <em>Pako</em> while I\u2019m ranting about all this, you\u2019re pretty much right on the money. You\u2019re given control of a tiny car in a tiny square town, and all you need to do is tap the left or right sides of the screen to steer while the vehicle auto-accelerates. There are police cars that chase you when you get too close to them, but they seem fairly weak and don\u2019t make much difference in the first few levels. The real goal, of course, is painting.</p>

aV<p>On paper it sounds like nothing more than a gimmicky little twist on a game that\u2019s largely still <em>Pako</em>, but I was surprised at how different that twist makes the whole experience feel. For instance, you have a limited amount of fuel so you can\u2019t just take your time and drive wherever you want forever. This means you have to choose your routes carefully as you try to efficiently paint as much of the level as you can--without going over the same areas twice--before sputtering to a stop after a few minutes.</p>

aV<p>The game also has a pretty smart progression system, with three rewards in each level based on how much of the area you are able to paint over. For example, on Map 12 you can unlock the next map, get 350 coins, and permanently add one slot to the energy timer if you manage to cover 80%, 88%, and 92% of the level, respectively. There are also over 30 rewards based on how far you drive total, like 20 extra seconds added to the magnet powerup for driving 500,000 meters. Finally, there\u2019s a daily goal to shoot for as well to ensure that you always have something to accomplish even when you\u2019ve finished the game.</p>

aV<p>Of course, this being a free-to-play joint, finishing the game is kind of a tall order. I\u2019ve already alluded to an energy system, but it\u2019s not too bad. Sure, it feels quite restrictive when you can only play six rounds at first, but eventually you\u2019ll unlock more \u201cbatteries\u201d and be able to play much longer. In fact, I currently have around nine and I\u2019m honestly starting to have trouble depleting all of them. For the first half of the game you pretty much always have enough coins and cars to complete every goal you come across, but it starts getting tougher after that. Some of the meter goals in particular seem almost impossible at this point, as they go all the way up into the millions and I can\u2019t imagine how many weeks of heavy playing that could take. Still, the meter goals in particular are not required to progress through the regular campaign of maps, and I\u2019m actually glad they get tougher as it means I\u2019ll have <em>plenty</em> of things to shoot for if I\u2019m still playing into the future. Oh, there are also ads every now and then, but you can remove them with any purchase of coins.</p>

aV<p>When I originally sat down to play <em>Splash Cars</em>, I certainly didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have quite this much to say about it. I mean, this review is probably approaching a half <a href="http://toucharcade.com/author/shaunm/" target="_blank">Musgrave</a> or more. Hopefully that fact alone will allay any concerns you have over this being a simple clone of <em>Pako</em>, which admittedly is very much what it looks like on the surface. And sure, if you took away the painting mechanics, that\u2019s pretty much all it would be. But those mechanics are so cleverly implemented that it honestly doesn\u2019t feel that close to any of its obvious inspirations while you play it, and that\u2019s a very good thing indeed. Its various parts may not be terribly original, but the whole package together is a surprisingly great experience--especially for being free. I\u2019d say that\u2019s worth painting the town red over.</p>
