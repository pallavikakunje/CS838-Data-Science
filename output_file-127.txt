I'll put my cards on the table: I wasn't a fan of the <+++> Boss Monster </+++> card game. I was heavily in to Magic: The Gathering back then and a few of the guys in our club went ga-ga for <+++> Boss Monster </+++> and threw some cash in to the <---> Kickstarter </---> but it never grabbed me in quite the same way.

Each room dealsÂ a certain amount of damage to the hero. <---> As </---> the game progresses you can build advanced rooms on top of the basic ones and these do more damage. If a hero survives your devious chain of rooms then he reaches you the boss monster and wounds you. <---> Five </---> wounds and you lose. But if your rooms do enough damage to kill the hero then you collect his soul. <---> Ten </---> souls and you win. Each room contains a certain type of treasure and different heroes are only interested in specific treasures. <---> So </---> you have to design your chain of rooms around doing enough damage to kill heroes but also having enough treasure to tempt them in the first place. It this balancing act that largely decides who will .
