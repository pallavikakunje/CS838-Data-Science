The mobile platform has created a market that I can't get enough of -- digital tabletop. Although the onlineÂ marketplace has created potential issues in terms of overcharging for cards expansions or game pieces playing a tabletop game without having to deal with any of the setup is a godsend in many instances particularly with games that take forever to lay out. <---> Â It </---> also allows games to flourish that wouldn't have existed otherwise like <+++> WWE SuperCard </+++> [Free]. The setup is rather simple and will be familiar to anyone who has played card battle games. <---> To </---> start five cards are chosen from a pool. All of them have a certain statistical spread -- power toughness speed and charisma. <---> For </---> each round of play a certain stat bonus will be favored -- so you may have John Cena who has a high charisma rating and <---> Big Show </---> who has a high power rating. You'll want to put them in on their respective advantage rounds taking into account that subsequent matches in each game will have other stats in the mix. Sometimes you'll have tag-team rounds where you choose two at once and sometimes multiple statlines will come into play. <---> You </---> can modify some stats with support cards like ladders and chairs to give yourself a little boost but that the gist of it. Everything is fast-paced and very simple to pick up. <---> Comedic </---> animations like suplexing cards will keep you laughing and interested as you essentially pick card after card and make minor modifications to it. For reference there no energy mechanic -- you just play to your heart content. <---> Thank </---> goodness! The only major problem I have with the game is that you can't go head-to-head with someone currently -- you're just playing with random people by way of matchmaking. .
