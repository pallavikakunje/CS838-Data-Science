If you like hacking away at something using a sharpened piece of metal with a handle you are probably a very happy camper with your mobile device. <---> Perhaps </---> you even think you have all the slice 'n' dice games a person could ever want. I'd like to humbly offer at least one more example for all the up and coming sword-fighters out there however. <+++> Only One </+++> [Free] is a pretty fresh take on a genre almost as old as the medium and it does so without any fancy motion controls or specular lighting. Pick up your sword and get ready for a serious test of your skills because you are the <+++> Only One </+++> who can survive. <---> Well </---> you and I guess all the other people who play the game and get good enough at it to win. <---> Probably </---> the <+++> Only One Thousand </+++>?Well that not really important. <---> What </---> is important is that you find yourself in a circular arena with nothing but a fatal drop surrounding you on all sides. In the middle of the arena is a sword waiting to be claimed. <---> Once </---> you do you'll start facing increasingly large waves of enemies intent on separating you from the mortal coil. Don't worry though you're awesome. Or at least you will be in time. <---> When </---> you start off all you can really do to defend yourself is run around and take swings at the enemies. Whenever you kill an enemy they'll drop an assortment of goodies including health pick-ups and most importantly power. <---> That </---> is unless you drop them off the side of the field. You don't get anything but points if you do that. <---> To </---> grow more powerful you need not only to gather power but also to survive as long as possible. As .
