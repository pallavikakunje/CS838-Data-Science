Our forums are a great place to interact directly with game developers. <---> In </---> particular the folks from Secret Exit have been peppering the discussion with insight into their latest release <+++> Turbo Dismount </+++> [Free]. <---> With </---> more than just a subtle nod to their previous title <+++> Stair Dismount </+++> [Free] Secret Exit have iterated and improved their formula with a high octane kick of adrenaline. <---> They </---> have brought their in home calamity sim out into the street and over from a desktop version to our mobile platform. You don't usually describe a game about decapitation and vehicular destruction as upbeat and comical but that the exact way I see <+++> Turbo Dismount </+++>. It a light-hearted physics sim that just happens to feature high speed collisions and dismemberment. <---> This </---> dissonance is a big part of my enjoyment of the game. Some people might see it as a grotesque and darkly humored game but I just see it as the next logical step if people at a crash test facility got bored and had a nice big budget. It may be due to desensitization but I really don't see a way to getting offended by the subject matter. <+++> Turbo Dismount </+++> is free with a pretty amazing IAP setup. <---> You </---> get 3 levels and 3 vehicles gratis and each additional unlock is $. 99. The great part is that the game has a vanishing full unlock. <---> It </---> starts as 5. 99 but gets deducted each time you make a small purchase. It comes right and says that you can unlock everything with just a handful of impulse buys. I can't say how awesome it is that Secret Exit really understands how to keep a pay model from distracting the player. <---> If </---> the only redeeming thing I could say about .
