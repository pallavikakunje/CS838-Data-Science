I have a love-hate relationship with horror films and games. <---> As </---> a rule I'm in love with older films which use practical effects to great success and deliver interesting and suspenseful stories. But as time progressed CG is often used as a crutch and horror has become increasingly more about shock or jump scares rather than a normalized sense of fear. It the same way for games but <+++> Dark Fear </+++> [$2. 99] manages to bring us back into the 80s in more ways than one. <---> With </---> a floppy disc boot up screen at the start I knew I was in for a treat with <+++> Dark Fear </+++>. If you're soley into fancy new visuals or top-end designs you'll probably want to stay far away. <---> But </---> for the rest of us the game evokes a sense of nostalgia with its own sense of personality to boot. For instance I adore the score rating at the top of the screen. In short this was used in older PC adventure games to provide the player with a sense of how far they were with the first digit representing successful puzzle solutions and the second indicating the end of the game. It still just as satisfying to complete a task and see that number go up years later. <---> Puzzles </---> are relatively straight-forward in nature at first but the game eventually ramps things up. But it doesn't stop there as there elements of exploration combat and even some RPG-like concepts like equipment and leveling. Â  <---> Said </---> combat has an action element to it with a small power meter that players can press to provide the greatest strike. It engaging enough and doesn't ever tread the line of boring since it never overused. <---> From </---> there other concepts like bribing NPCs for hints show .
