I had several moments while playing <---> EinheitB </---> <+++> Cavernaut </+++> [$0. 99] where I thought to myself <---> This </---> is exactly why I love mobile. <---> It </---> a game that probably not going to change the world but that okay. It just a great tight little experience that could really only exist on this platform. <---> In </---> <+++> Cavernaut </+++> you play as a little LEM-inspired craft that needs to make it to the surface of a very deep and complex cave system. (Actually the craft--and the game itself--was probably more inspired by <---> Atari </---> classic <+++> Lunar Lander </+++> than anything humans have done in real life. ) Each round begins with your little ship at the bottom of a randomly generated cave and your job is to tilt and thrust your way up as far as you can before running out of fuel or crashing into something deadly. <---> The </---> fuel needs to be used carefully since each time you fire one of your jets you'll be expending a small amount of it. It adds up (or subtracts I suppose) quickly but thankfully there are refueling stations scattered about that will top you off if you land on one. That the gist but there are also a number of items you can collect along the way. <---> First </---> there are glowing yellow dots called Luminum Crystals. <---> These </---> contribute to your score but they also act as the game currency (which we'll get to in a bit). There are also powerups to collect that enhance your lander abilities for the duration of your run. <---> Finally </---> you can seek out little yellow cubes that unlock mysterious artifacts. These don't affect the gameplay at all but provide a welcome long-term goal if you are a completionist. <---> All </---> of this is pretty basic stuff but what surprised me .
