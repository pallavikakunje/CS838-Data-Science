When people claim that gameplay takes precedent above all else including visual fidelity I ask why not both? There have been plenty of games that have pushed the envelope in just about every facet imaginable including the recent <+++> Witcher 3Â  </+++>from CD Projekt Red.

I'm always searching out new games to play whether they're eastern Cave-based shooters or western titles like <+++> Siberian Strike </+++>.

The basic concept is simple -- players can swipe around the screen to move their ship which automatically fires at opponents. <---> It </---> your job to avoid fire and get into a more strategic position to take out enemies. So in that basic sense it your typical mobile shooter. <---> But </---> once you start to really dig past the surface it becomes much more involved. For instance you can also tap the screen to drop a bomb which takes out ground targets that your aerial dogfighter can't otherwise hit. Â  <---> It </---> takes some practice but with time you'll be dodging and bombing like a pro. Upgrades also significantly alter your playstyle from wingmen that follow your ship around for some extra firepower to brand new characters that have new mechanics in .
