Some people like to curl up with a good book to relax I like to curl up with a challenging game. While that sounds like the opposite of therapy for a lot of people I enjoy the notion of testing my brain especially with a casual setting like a mobile device where I can pick it up and play anytime. <+++> Cube Koala </+++> [Free] pretty much encapsulates that ideology. <---> Set </---> to the tune of a bizarre and simplistic setup Koala stars the titular hero who is stuck in a deadly tesseract contraption by way of <---> Sharksuit </---> -- a creepy antagonist who simply hates koalas. It your job to tilt the cube in either direction with large on-screen buttons on either side and send him to the door to safety. <---> At </---> first things start out easy enough with no traps and no real way to perish but soon enough disintegrating blocks spikes and other hazards rear their ugly heads. The obvious parallel for <+++> Koala </+++>Â is <+++> Super Meat Boy </+++> with the frantic nature of one-life runs and the stark challenge involved. <---> The </---> influences go even further with a set of dark worlds tougher levels designed to test your mettle even further than the core game. While it may wear said influences on its sleeve <---> Koala </---> is definitely its ownÂ  beast complete with its own set of trials and tribulations. One unique element is the zoom function which allows you to see the action from a birds-eye view. <---> The </---> catch is that you can't actually play zoomed out which forces you to memorize locations of traps. Your primary goal is going to be getting a three-star rating on each course which is much harder than it sounds. <---> Thankfully </---> there a lot more there than meets the eye when it .
