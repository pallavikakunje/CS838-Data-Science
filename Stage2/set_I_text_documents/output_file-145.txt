<+++> Cosmic Crown </+++> [Free] is just an undeniably cool game. It a roguelike particularly in the vein of <+++> Hoplite </+++> [$2. 99] where there are occasional upgrades after levels to improve oneself with. <---> But </---> the uncommon twist about the game is that it entirely one-dimensional literally. The only movement is forward and backward with traps enemies and slowly-opening doors serving as the things standing between the green protagonist and those sweet cosmic crowns. <---> For </---> a game that has just one-dimensional movement it not a shallow game at all. This is because of the dash and disrupt abilities. <---> The </---> dash serves as a handy way to bypass traps and skip past the sentinels but it has a short recharge time to deal with. Disrupting can be extremely helpful but has a long recharge time and can lead to being trapped if not careful. <---> There </---> is waiting but things like the sentinels and forced-movement arrow tiles make everything a threat. The game thus makes every move require careful consideration because there so many dangers. <---> Getting </---> in the rhythm of how the various traps work at any given moment is key. One miscalculation is often deadly and calculating that proper thing to do gets more complicated as threats increase over time and the dark crowns start getting collected. <---> But </---> <+++> Cosmic Crown </+++> remains accessible because the number of inputs is so simple there only six things to do at any given time: go forward go backward wait dash forward dash backward use disrupt. Strategy comes into play with upgrade choices. <---> Go </---> for the enhancements to dashing and disrupting? Having the dash recharge after a disrupt is extremely handy especially when avoiding the sentinels. <---> But </---> then there also the purified crowns which grant a scoring bonus to those going for high .
