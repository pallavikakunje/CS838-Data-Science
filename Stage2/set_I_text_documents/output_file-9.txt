Is your brain working properly? <---> Are </---> things in the world making too much sense? If you answered yes to these questions and you desire that your brain be thrown into the washing machine and then crushed with a hammer then <+++> Causality </+++> [$1. 99] is the game for you. <---> It </---> a puzzle game for people who like their games to make sense. . . kinda sorta. It a fun game but one that will threaten your sense of perception and time. <---> The </---> basic goal of <+++> Causality </+++> is to get each astronaut from their starting point to the end point in one piece with each square that they move taking up one turn. You can move all along the timeline of moves where your method of navigating these astronauts is by swapping arrow tiles to send them in different directions. <---> Where </---> things start to get thrown into strange loops is when the time travel portal is introduced. An astronaut sent into this portal will travel back in time to a fixed point on the timeline and this clone must be used to get to the goal. <---> However </---> it can interact with even the original so you have to figure out just what it is supposed to do and factor it into the entirety of your plan. <+++> Causality </+++> time-travel portal element can be tough to understand even as you play it or try to watch it. So on levels with a portal they always will send the character that enters them back into the specific spot on the timeline. <---> So </---> the ideal time to send a character into the portal is as late as possible to get as many actions in as you can. Now where things get screwy is that the time travel clone will appear .
