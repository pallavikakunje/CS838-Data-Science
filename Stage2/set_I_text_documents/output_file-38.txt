It hard to recall what the first flight simulator game I played was. I believe it was <+++> Wing Commander </+++> on the PC before I graduated on to other space games like theÂ  <+++> X-Wing </+++> and <+++> TIE FighterÂ  </+++>series as well asÂ  <+++> Descent </+++>. <---> Either </---> way it was love at first sight. The cold loneliness of space translated perfectly to the video game realm and the possibilities were endless since the theme wasn't tethered to any particular planet or rules. <---> Any </---> given day my adventures could take me to another uncharted region I've never seen before either teeming with life or completely silent. And that really is the magic of sci-fi -- you can never truly be prepared for what it might throw at you next. Â  <+++> Hyperburner </+++> [$2. 99] doesn't really break any conventions that have been present for the past 20 years or so but it one heck of a ride. <---> And </---> so does the control scheme which provides a heap of different options to choose from. You can go with the traditional third-person view or first-person cockpit both of which change up your fundamental approach to the game. <---> But </---> what I really dig is the power to fine-tune the sensitivity of your ship (which can be adjusted to the tee)Â and test it right there on the options menu. <---> It </---> a really cool feature as is the instant pause mechanic when you lift your finger off the screen. It saved me many a time when I looked up at something else. Each zone has its own signature art style complete with unique hazards to face. <---> Said </---> objects might be moving or static but either way it going to take some skill to navigate around them. The patterns are wonderfully crafted almost puzzle-like -- so there .
