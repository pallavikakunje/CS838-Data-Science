When you have a trailer as awesome as <+++> Block Legend </+++> [$1. 99] you better have a good game behind it to back up that hype goodness. <---> Luckily </---> the devs behind this RPG puzzler matched their self-made hype and then some. <---> Streamlined </---> combat (complete with random encounters) loads of unlockable content and a robust RPG match-2 overlay combine for an amazing experience that needs to be checked out. <+++> Block Legend </+++> takes a lot of inspiration from a variety of previous puzzle <---> iOS </---> games. The combat is reminiscent of the classic <+++> <html><body><a href=http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Dungeon_Hero>Dungeon Hero</a></body></html> </+++> with tiles on the board for experience physical attacks replenishing life etc. <---> However </---> the game runs in real time similar to 10000000 [$2. 99]. With the grata foundation of these two games <+++> Block Legend </+++> takes the game play even further with a full-on RPG adventure complete with visiting towns shops finding treasure and fighting bosses. In that regard it almost reminds me of <+++> <html><body><a href=http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Half-Minute_Hero>Half-Minute Hero</a></body></html> </+++> except with puzzle-based game play. <---> The </---> combination of <+++> Block Legend </+++> matched the gameplay with the battle mechanic makes for an experience that is both tense and frenetic. This tension is why I think I enjoy it so much. <---> It </---> one thing to have a simple RPG puzzler that turn-based but having to be on your toes at all times really brings fast relaxes into the mix. The RPG mechanics which include an experience leveling system spells and potions to discover and progressively harder monsters means that the experience is constantly evolving and challenging. Even the matching mechanics themselves offer more strategy that most other games. A combo system spells that clear out areas of the board and a conversion system that changes blocks in between battles .
