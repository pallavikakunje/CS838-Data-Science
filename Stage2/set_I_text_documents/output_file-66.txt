Growing up some of my favorite games were adventure titles. <---> Ones </---> you could just get lost in exploring an uncharted and dangerous world. There was something so unique about those experiences -- where you had no concept of what to expect and no knowledge of where to go. <---> It </---> helped prepare me for games like <+++> King Field </+++> and the <+++> Souls </+++> series and I'm always grateful that developers were making games like that testing the boundaries of the unknown. That partially why <+++> Captain Cowboy </+++> [$0. 99] is so great as it captures the essence of so many of those bygone classics while sticking to a tried and true adventure formula. <---> Tossed </---> into an unknown world the titular Captain is placed in unfamiliar territory. <---> Right </---> away I wasn't exactly sure what to do and that a pretty rare feeling in this era of obscene tutorials. I came to realize that diamonds were some sort of score element and progressing to the edge of the screen triggered a transition to the next area. Now we're in business. <---> Learning </---> the ins and outs of the environment is key. You can dig through areas of dirt but some house boulders which can be dropped strategically to open new areas or simply fall on your head. <---> More </---> concepts open up as you play all of which have their own rulesets attached. Enemies will seek you out lasers will try to block your path and the environment shifts to accommodate these changes as well. Truthfully I would have been fine if the game was primarily based on the starting area because of how well it done but variety is the spice of life after all. Control-wise it relatively easy to move around. Tapping isn't necessarily ideal as it can move you .
