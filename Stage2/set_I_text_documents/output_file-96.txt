ToÂ explain why I wanted to give <+++> Dandy: Or a Brief Glimpse Into the Life of a Candy Alchemist </+++>Â [$3. 99] a try once I saw it pop up on the App Store I first need to talk a bit about the type of shoot 'em ups I enjoy. One of the few genres of games I've never cared much forÂ is bullet-hell shoot 'em ups those games where you fight aÂ constantÂ hail of fire while trying not to get a headache from all the blinking and flashing. Â TheÂ shoot 'em ups I enjoy areÂ the slower ones the kindÂ that forces you to study your enemies and devise strategies on the go (like the PC game <+++> <html><body><a href=http://bindingofisaac. com/>The Binding of Isaac</a></body></html> </+++> for instance) and this is precisely the kind of gameplayÂ  <+++> Dandy </+++> offers. <---> Playing </---> as Dandy a cute little alchemist you traverse a beautifully-drawn 2D world toÂ tackle a variety of enemies each with its own specific behavior asÂ you try to get as far as you can before perishing. You'll discoverÂ some very smart design decisions behind <+++> Dandy </+++> gameplay that make it a challenging but thoroughly-entertaining shoot 'em up that rewards patience strategizing and skill without sacrificing speed. Dandy is apparently a candy alchemist which is my kind of alchemist. <---> The </---> game webpageÂ offers partÂ of the game backstory talkingÂ about how Dandy was the last in a dwindling line of candy alchemists who obsessed with searching for alchemical ingredients went mad during his journey into the ruins of an ancient world. <---> When </---> you play <+++> Dandy </+++> for the first time you can sense thatÂ there a story behind this game there an idea that was probably pretty well formed in the minds of the developers. Still I wish they had shared some of it with the playersÂ at the beginning of the game .
