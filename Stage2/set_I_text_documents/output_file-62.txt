Several times in my life Iâve fantasized about packing up my guitar and some recording equipment and moving to a remote cabin for a month or so to write and record music. <---> Far </---> removed from the stress distraction and responsibility of normal life Iâd be free to put all my energy into crafting the next <+++> Sgt. Pepperâs </+++> or <+++> Pet Sounds </+++>. (Itâs a fantasy after all. ) Unfortunately doing such a thing is a luxury most people canât afford for a number of reasons which means Iâll have to settle for squeezing my recording sessions into spare hours in the garage like normal. <---> Apparently </---> game developers have similar fantasies because last year there was a game accelerator program that took place over two months in a remote cabin in Stockholm. Aspiring developers from all over the world met there and were given the time and resources to create the game of their dreams with coaching from industry professionals. <---> It </---> was called Stugan (Swedish for âcabinâ) and the very first complete game to come out of the experiment is _PRISM [$2. 99] by Clint Siu. Itâs a sleek little puzzler that tasks you with solving various abstract puzzles while manipulating shapes in 3D space.

The whole experience feels wonderfully alien as thereâs no text and very very little instruction explaining what youâre supposed to do. <---> For </---> that reason I .
