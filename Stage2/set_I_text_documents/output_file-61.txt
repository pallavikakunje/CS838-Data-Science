<+++> Patchwork </+++>[$2. 99] is a very cute game. It has a charming facade of quilty-buttony comfort that is really quite inviting and calming. <---> It </---> almost a shame that the game is very much a game of cut-throat cold logic devoid of much wiggle room around the fact that the person who can plan ahead best will usually win. The master mind behind such board game greats as <+++> Agricola </+++>[$6. 99] and <+++> Le Havre </+++>[$4. 99] <---> Uwe Rosenberg </---> followed the pattern with a really great strategic/economic design on this one. This game is built as purely a two player game. <---> While </---> it does not lend itself to a flexible party size <+++> Patchwork </+++> follows the golden rule of strategic gaming: easy to learn and difficult to master. In the course of the game you will accrue buttons that allow you to purchase scraps of cloth. <---> Each </---> scrap of cloth has not only a button cost but also a movement cost and is the method of advancing along the game board. Each player starts with an empty quilt board that can be filled in with the tetris-like scrap pieces. <---> Whomever </---> is further behind on the game board takes the next turn and you can actually engineer things to take multiple turns in a row. Each turn you can select a single scrap out of a selection of three or pass your turn and advance on the game board to be exactly one space ahead of your opponent. <---> Your </---> mission is to gather more buttons and fill out your quilt board as much as possible before reaching the end of the game board. Whomever amasses more buttons and loses the least amount of points for open spaces in their quilt board wins. <---> It </---> may not be obvious on first .
