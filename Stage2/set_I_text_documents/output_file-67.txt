From the first time I saw it <+++> Momoka </+++> [$6. 99] always had me a bit on edge. It looked cool but something about the game production values always seemed to leave me feeling like this could be a mediocre game. <---> The </---> visuals felt like they were on the wrong side between ugly and intentional low fidelity. Something about the way characters moved and operated left me feeling like this could be what could be succinctly summarized as a janky game. <---> Janky </---> games are frustrating because they could and should be great but often get in the way of themselves with things like bugs poor controls and ill-advised design decisions. <+++> Momoka </+++> certainly flirts with jankiness and has some rough edges that make it not the smoothest experience ever no. But it constructed so well that its flaws stay out of the way of this fantastic <---> Metroidvania </---> platformer. You play as the eponymous <---> Momoka </---> equipped with a laser gun and the mission to restore the dying energy of the sun. You'll explore an interconnected world in your galaxy using abilities and upgrades you earn to traverse sections that were once impassable. The story and setup are nothing too original but <+++> Momoka </+++> manages to do the basics quite well while also throwing in some clever features along the way. <---> Structure </---> wise <+++> Momoka </+++> guides you through the first part of the game until you get your rocket ship when you can explore the galaxy on your own. The rocket is worthy of note as it feels cool to actually fly around and explore for yourself not just to go somewhere on a map. <---> It </---> possible to get stuck or land in spots where you have to backtrack to a rocket station to escape but it only .
