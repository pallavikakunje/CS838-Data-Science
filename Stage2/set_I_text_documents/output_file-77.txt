<+++> Digfender </+++> [Free] is basically a tower defense game combined with a âdiggingâ game (if you couldnât tell from the title alone). As far as the TD stuff is concerned itâs all pretty standard. Youâve got waves of different enemies marching toward your base (a castle in this case) and your job is to stop them by planting various weaponized towers in strategic places that will slow or kill the hordes. The towers themselves are pretty typical too with a fire tower shock tower freeze tower and bomb tower each with branching upgrade paths a la <+++> Kingdom Rush </+++> [Free]. <---> On </---> top of that youâve got several support towers that connect to the weapons to boost things like damage range and gold drops. Where things get really interesting is in the digging aspects of the game. <---> See </---> most tower defense games handle enemy paths in one of two ways: either with fixed paths that you have to place your towers around (like the <+++> Sentinel </+++> games) or by using the towers themselves to create your own path (like the <+++> Fieldrunners </+++> games). <+++> Digfenders </+++> essentially combines those two designs by actually letting you tap out your own path through a level first (by âdiggingâ down) and then placing the towers wherever you want around that path. It may seem like a small difference but it adds a surprising amount to the gameplay. Itâs basically the best of both worlds. <---> It </---> keeps the creative aspect of making your own way through each level but you donât have to worry about running out of money while doing so since digging doesnât cost anything. Of course if you could just plow through each stage with no restrictions things would get too easy or too boring (or both most .
