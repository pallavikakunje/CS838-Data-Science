I mentioned recently in my review of <+++> Baseball Apocalypse </+++>[$0. 99] that I love impossible games. One of those games comes from developer/publisher Invictus. <---> Now Invictus </---> puts out a lot of games very few of which actually interest me though they seem to have found their footing in the last couple years. There are a handful of gems in their library that really truly shine. I'm talking the supremely elegant <+++> Greed Corp </+++>[$0. 99] the heavy metal monster mash <+++> Tap 'n Slash </+++>[Free] and the game that I name dropped in said review <+++> Give It Up! </+++>[$0. 99]. While the original game grew with a handful of updates a sequel was being made and that sequel is pretty magnificent. I give you <+++> Give It Up! 2 </+++>[Free]. (I'd have gone with something like <+++> Give It Up Again! </+++> but I digress)I was already intrigued by this series at the title. I love games with self aware titles or titles that directly address the player. Kind of like <+++> Try Harder </+++>[Free] from [adult swim] (which I also reviewed). Where that game is positive and encouraging in its title <+++> Give It Up </+++> doesn't even seem to want you to play at all. <---> Few </---> titles say Just bring it! quite as well. <---> You </---> know except the old WWE game called exactly that. <---> Anyway </---> <+++> Give It Up! 2 </+++> is a satanic fusion of rhythm games and impossible games in which you hop along to the fast paced beat tapping at just the right time to jump. You can jump to skip a space that holds a hazard or gap or you can jump up to reach a single space higher platform directly in front of you. <---> Everything </---> follows the same rules and logic .
