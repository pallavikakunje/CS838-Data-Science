I don't know about you but I always get unnerved at the death of tiny cute anthropomorphic things. Most people can rationalize that a banana getting grinded up into bits but when you hear their screams and see blood splattering across the screen it a little different. <---> Thankfully </---> the point of <+++> Don't Grind </+++> [Free] is to save these little creatures but as most endless games prove death is inevitable. Maybe that why it makes me so uncomfortable. I was initially drawn to <+++> Don't Grind </+++> due to a community recommendation but the artwork immediately pulled me toward it. It looks like something out of <---> Tokidoki </---> but the team over at Laser Dog Games put their own spin on it and created a likable cast of characters that consist of basic household items and food -- like toasters apples milkshakes and of course bananas. <---> The </---> loop is like a truncated version of <+++> Super Meat Boy </+++>. There no platforming involved per se your job is to just tap the screen and prevent the character of your choosing from falling into giant buzzsaws at the bottom. <---> By </---> tapping the screen plainly you can manipulate your height and by swiping you can move your object from side to side. Think of tapping like juggling a soccer ball by yourself -- it'll give the object a slight upward kick but the operative word here is slight as you'll need to stay on top of it to keep it airborne. <---> It </---> gets even tougher once you add in enemies and hazards to the mix like more buzzsaws that can appear anywhere on any side of the screen and Bullet Bill-esque missile cannons that you'll sometimes have to juggle between. <---> The </---> entire point isn't just survival either as you're aiming to collect .
