Enter the dungeon go as far as you can gather some loot get some experience and get out before you get killed. <---> Go </---> back in get a little farther grab a bit more loot get a bit stronger and escape again. Almost every great dungeon crawler has a pretty similar hook to it and it works time and time again. <---> It </---> fun to build a character something that sits at the heart of almost all RPGs and these days plenty of non-RPGs. <---> There </---> a certain thrill in finding a special piece of equipment we haven't seen before too. But the biggest thing I think the sub-genre has going for it is its near-perfect realization of risk vs. reward. Oh every game uses this to some extent or at least the decent ones do but the reward is usually something relatively meaningless. A little more progress a nice power-up a cool new gun or something like that. <+++> The Enchanted Cave 2 </+++> [$2. 99] like most of its dungeon-crawling brethren puts an extra ante on the table something more precious than any piece of loot: your time. <+++> The Enchanted Cave 2 </+++> is a rather smart combination. It mostly a turn-based dungeon crawler but it sprinkles in a few choice bits from roguelikes to spice up the equation. You're tasked with exploring a magical cave for reasons that don't really matter all that much. <---> It </---> filled with treasure and monsters in near-equal proportions but your main goal on each floor is to find the stairs leading down to the next one. If you simply rush down the staircase each time you find it however your character will soon be in too deep to survive. <---> You </---> have to explore at least a little on each level picking up some loot .
