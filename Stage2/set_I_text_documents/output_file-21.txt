Semidome made a splash with their artsy debut <+++> Last Voyage </+++> [$1. 99]. <---> It </---> was an artsy yet eclectic experience as its ten chapters ran the gamut of gameplay styles to convey its abstract story. Semidome isn't done conveying this abstract digital atmosphere in their second title <+++> Nightgate </+++> [Free]. <---> It </---> positions itself as a more singular experience but one that succeeds in creating a fascinating landscape for players to experience for just a little while. <+++> Nightgate </+++> gives you a single basic task of having to survive levels full of hazards to progress to the next one flying around like an arena-survival game. You advance by activating nodes with different kinds that pop up like ones that have to be linked without any enemies or hazards contacting the links. <---> There </---> are some different switches that pop up too but in general it all about the nodes. That not to say the game is monotonous at all â the level design and hazards you have to deal with are varied enough and spread out well. You'll see some repetition of particular challenges throughout the 50 levels but they're spread out well enough that it doesn't feel annoying it just that you'll recognize them. <---> The </---> enemies that offer relentless pursuit add a tricky wrinkle. In general <+++> Nightagte </+++> is a title that you can complete through perseverance as there aren't any excessively difficult timing puzzles or mazes to navigate through. Lesser-skilled players can still have fun with this and complete the game. <+++> Nightgate </+++> doesn't overstay its welcome â each gate only takes a few minutes to complete though with 50 of them you can sit down with this one for some time even in a stop and start way as I did.
