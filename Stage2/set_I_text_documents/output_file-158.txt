Side-scrolling games where you ride through a course performing tricks and stunts seem to be all the rage these days mostly thanks to the sudden popularity the <+++> Trials </+++> series found several years ago. That rise coincided nicely with the fall of 3D open world trick games like the <+++> Tony Hawk Pro Skater </+++> series ensuring that trick-crazy gamers wouldn't go hungry.

You unlock the next one by clearing all of the challenges in the current difficulty tier. <---> The </---> stages are .
