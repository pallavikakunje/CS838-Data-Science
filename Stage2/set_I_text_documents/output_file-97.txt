I was a fan of <---> TouchArcade </---> long before I was a writer here and one of my favorite of the more recent regular features is Shaunâs <---> Update Mondays </---> posts. The weird thing is the updates themselves arenât even why I look forward to it every week. Rather itâs because I think Shaunâs a funny dude and I just enjoy reading his descriptions of each update. <---> More </---> specifically I need to know what game he decides to give the coveted <+++> Update Mondays Most Spider-Mans Of The Week Award </+++> to. <---> Is </---> it going to be <+++> Spider-Man Unlimited </+++> [Free] again? (I mean it does get a lot of Spider-Mans. ) <---> Or </---> will it be something completely random? Well I think I may have found a good future candidate. Iâm talking about A Small Gameâs <+++> Hanger World </+++> [Free] and itâs packed full of all kinds of <---> Spider-Mans </---> slinging themselves this way and that. As it turns out itâs also a really really fun game. <---> Actually </---> a good way to describe the game would be âSpider-Man meets <+++> Super Meat Boy </+++>â. <---> (Try </---> saying that ten times fast. No twenty. Weâll wait. ) <---> You </---> play as a number of differently colored stick figures who have the ability to shoot rope from their hands. Once a rope hits something (usually the ceiling) youâll be at the mercy of some rather cartoony physics as you swing wildly across the screen. <---> The </---> goal then is to make it to the end of each level in one piece. Or any number of pieces really. <---> Just </---> make sure you still have a head and some shoulders by the end (which is good advice in real life as well). So yeah youâre probably gonna lose some limbs along the way. Thatâs okay though because itâs .
