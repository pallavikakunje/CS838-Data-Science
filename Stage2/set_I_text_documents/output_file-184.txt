Penguins are one of natureâs most fascinating creatures. <---> In </---> the years that have passed weâve seen movies such as Happy Feet and Surfâs <---> Up </---> pay homage to natureâs most wonderful aquatic flightless birds but upon general observation penguins are known primarily for their gracefulness elegance and their unusual upright waddling gait. Theyâre also incredibly badass and if thereâs any game that will demonstrate this GameResortâs <+++> Adventure Beaks </+++> [Free] is most certainly the iOS game to capture your hearts. <---> In </---> this charming little platform runner you lead a highly elite squad of penguins as they slide dive swim and belly-flop their way across icy glaciers and large bodies of water on their hunt for artifacts treasure and various goofy outfits. Along the way youâll have to time your jumps and dives perfectly in order to avoid obstacles kick seal butt and reach the other end in one piece. <---> Should </---> one penguin fail on his mission the next penguin immediately takes over and so long as youâve hit a checkpoint (more on that in a second) youâll start straight away from that position. You have two control schemes to pick from. <---> One </---> involves swiping up and down to jump dive and slide and the other involves tapping on the left side of the screen for sliding and diving and the right side for jumping. I found the swiping system fairly spot on (if not a little hard initially to get to grips with) but both work just as well as each other. <+++> Adventure Beaks </+++> is one game that rewards you with its high replay value. <---> On </---> each run-through aside from the countless treasures and valuables youâll scoop up along the way youâll also come across numerous pieces of an artifact scattered across each level. Essential for unlocking further .
