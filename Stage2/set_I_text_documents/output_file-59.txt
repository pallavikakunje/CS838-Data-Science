One of my favorite childhood games on PC was ZZT. It was a simple adventure game that was solely comprised of ANSI characters to the point where everything even the hero looked like text. It was done so well though that the low-fi angle worked and even though it wasn't all that impressive even for the time it was endearing and memorable. <---> That </---> basically how I feel about <+++> Tomb of the Mask </+++> [Free] which goes for a very similar retro effect with similar results. <+++> Tomb of the Mask </+++> isn't quite on the same scale at least at first glance. <---> It </---> an endless experience but instead of running from the usual left to right you're ascending up <+++> Doodle Jump </+++> style. To do this you'll traverse straight lines leaping from wall to wall with quick swipes in any direction. <---> It </---> a precise control scheme that once again shows off how deep touch controls can be and works perfectly within the confines of the game. Much like <+++> Crossy Road </+++> new concepts can arise at any time. <---> Whether </---> it figuring out spike traps that shoot projectiles are certain intervals or enemies that blow up like puffer fish and block a corridor things are never boring in <+++> Tomb of the Mask </+++>. And I especially love that as you ascend you'll clear specific levels of sorts that bring players into new themes giving off the allure of progression without implicitly stating it. <---> It </---> a retro-style level system that fits the aesthetic perfectly and honestly is something that should be the golden standard more often. When players are tasked with a constant stream of the same locales over and over with no real end in sight even if said end doesn't exist tedium will happen. <---> But </---> here .
