The folks at <---> Prettygreat </---> consisting of a few ex-Halfbrick developers have launched their first game <+++> Land Sliders </+++> [Free] and it shows that they still have the spark that led them to help create games like <+++> Fruit Ninja </+++> [$1. 99 / Free] and <+++> Jetpack Joyride </+++> [Free]. <---> This </---> is a high-score chaser where collecting items across the various levels while avoiding danger is the goal but the mechanic you play the game with is really quite clever: you slide the game world around like you would scroll through a web page. The natural and fun feeling of these controls along with all the work put into creating an enjoyable game world make <+++> Land Sliders </+++> a fantastic game. <---> What </---> so interesting about <+++> Land Sliders </+++> versus other <+++> Crossy </+++>-style games is that it a game about exploration. There not really any time-based factor compelling you to advance at least that I ever saw. You are rewarded for going around the levels and picking up as many of the items as you can possibly get with a bonus for collecting all of the items in a level before you warp on to the next one. <---> But </---> of course you have to deal with the enemies and various hazards that are also present. So you have to balance out getting the reward on that level with just surviving and advancing. I will say that the game nature of sliding makes it difficult to do a lot of dodging. The pogo dinosaurs in particular have a decided advantage on you. <---> Avoiding </---> danger as much as possible is key. As to be expected from a bunch of <---> ex-Halfbrick </---> folks the production values on <+++> Land Sliders </+++> are fantastic. And with investment from the <+++> Crossy Road .
