I absolutely love <---> Neutronized </---> pixel art stylings. They added a lot of flair to their previous games <+++> Roar Rampage </+++> [$0. 99] and <+++> Lost Yeti </+++> [$1. 99] though both were darn good games in their own rights. <---> Now </---> they've returned with another pixelly game and one that pays homage to single-screen arcade classics like <+++> Bubble Bobble </+++> with <+++> Drop Wizard </+++> [$1. 99]. It definitely a game that paying homage to the classics and feels like it'd be a great fit in an arcade cabinet from 25 years ago or so. <---> But Neutronized </---> don't just rest on their laurels with the retro homage they actually make a game that remarkably clever in and of itself. <+++> Drop Wizard </+++> objective is to clear the screen of enemies doing so by stunning them with stars that get shot out of the hero wizard wand. The hero can only shoot a star when dropping from one platform to another and the levels loop from bottom to top. <---> As </---> such each level becomes a puzzle to decipher. Which path needs to be taken to get back to the top on one side? <---> How </---> can movement be timed in order to hit enemies properly? The game is controlled by auto-running with taps on the left and right sides of the screen to go in those directions so hanging around on a platform and/or near a wall to time when an enemy needs to be hit is key to many levels. <---> Enemies </---> can be stunned with the stars and then hit to knock them around as they roll into a ball. Here another key part of the game: chaining together enemy hits. A single enemy can hit one wall before dissipating into a points-giving candy item. Rolling enemies can pick .
