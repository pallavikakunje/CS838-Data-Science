No matter how you slice it making a sequel to <+++> Siralim </+++> [Free] was always going to be a tough job. <---> The </---> original game is essentially an overstuffed endless pit of RPG joy densely packed with enough systems side content and additional challenges to keep any genre fan busy for dozens of hours or more. <---> In </---> hindsight it was almost an impossible achievement. It was developer <---> Thylacine </---> first stab at the genre and it was extremely unconventional. Mixing elements of monster-catching base-building and roguelikes it was like someone made a delicious <+++> Shin Megami Tensei </+++> - <+++> Romancing SaGa </+++> - <+++> Rogue </+++> sandwich and somehow pulled that blend off with only a few minor hitches. <---> Excellent </---> post-release support ironed out just about all of the game issues leaving one to wonder what exactly a sequel could accomplish. Well I think I've learned my lesson about doubting <---> Thylacine </---> chops. <+++> Siralim 2 </+++> [$4. 99] takes everything great about the first game adds a few smartly-designed systems to give players even more to do and tosses a story in there for good measure. It not a particularly great story mind you but it should help give guidance to players who found themselves lost with the lack of direction in the first game. <---> The </---> presentation is considerably more consistent than in the original game though it still has a fair bit of roughness on the visual end of things. Suffice it to say if you played the first game and loved it you can throw down your money without hesitation here. <---> Everything </---> you enjoyed in the previous title is here and the new content is highly welcome for novices and experts alike. For newcomers it a tougher question. <---> This </---> is definitely the game to get out of the .
