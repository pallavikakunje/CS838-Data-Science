Isometric puzzle games pretty much have me at hello. <---> There </---> something about the lovely god-like viewpoint that gives me a sense of wonder in addition to a strict sense of control that I really dig. <+++> Monument Valley </+++> [$3. 99] is pretty much the king of the mobile space when it comes to those experiences yet a number of games have risen to the call and have cemented themselves as worthy adversaries. <---> While </---> <+++> Mekorama </+++> [Free] isn't as attractive when it comes to its art style (the base game clocks in at just 8MB!) it makes up for it in charm and a pretty nifty level editor. Unlike a lot of other daunting puzzle games <+++> Mekorama i </+++>s highly accessible. You'll control a little robot as he embarks upon a journey to a set goal location controlling him by tapping where you want to head to. <---> Since </---> each space is broken up in a grid-like fashion it easy to figure out exactly where the robot needs to go by tapping an individual square. There pretty much no room for error even on a device with less screen real estate. If I had one criticism regarding the camera though it would be that the zoom function is a little too basic. By pinching to zoomÂ  you can get closer to the action but unfortunately there no way to focus in on the character itself -- so often times zooming in is pointless. <---> The </---> high focus on verticality allows for some pretty cool concepts to be sure. There levels where you'll descend underwater in attempt to locate a goal obfuscated by liquid and challenges where one might have to take a leap of faith to drop to a lower platform. <---> You </---> can't just tap anywhere and automatically win either .
