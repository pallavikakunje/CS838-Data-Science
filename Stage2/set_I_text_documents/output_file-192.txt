Many of you may not remember the <---> iOS </---> marketplace in 2009 but when it was released <+++> Eliss </+++> was a dominant authority in the puzzle arena. Now it back five years later in the form of <+++> Eliss Infinity </+++> [$2. 99] and the good news is it better than ever. <---> Somehow </---> <+++> Infinity </+++> manages to balance both puzzle and action elements to near perfection. Don't be intimidated by the fact that it a puzzle game -- it deceptively easy to pick up. Basically different color planets will appear on the screen and so will colored dotted lines to place them in. <---> Your </---> job is to take each color and shove it into it goal so to speak. That it! <---> Well </---> kinda. Your objective is complicated by the fact that you can meld smaller planets together into larger ones and the goals are of varying sizes. <---> At </---> first it a bit tough to judge sizes at a moment notice but given the well designed nature of the planets it'll become second nature. Likewise you can also use two fingers to rip planets apart like cellular organisms to create more objects or resize them to put them into smaller goals. <---> The </---> simple concept of combining and separating planets like this makes for some incredibly engaging gameplay as you have multiple courses of action at every turn. This is further complicated by a restriction -- different color planets can't touch each other lest they deplete your health bar forcing you to restart a level. <---> Later </---> levels will spawn planets very quickly leaving you to combine and split them with multiple fingers before you start rapidly losing health. Once vortexes come into the mix that destroy your planets on their own things get even more tricky. <---> If </---> it sounds fast paced .
