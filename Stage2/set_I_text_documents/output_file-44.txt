I always seem to gravitate towards <---> Nitrome </---> games. I don't know what it is but I always pick up their latest game not knowing that it actually them. And there a common theme after all these experiences -- I usually come out enjoying myself. With a neat new gimmick now I can addÂ  <+++> Leap Day </+++> [Free] to that list. Jumping can get very technical especially when spikes moving platforms and roaming enemies (or those who lie in wait) enter the equation. <+++> Leap Day </+++> rolls with the best of them in that regard and becomes a thinking man game in many ways forcing the player to divine the best possible solution for any given puzzle. <---> And </---> that what a lot of the game sections are -- puzzles -- sometimes with multiple solutions in tow. It simple and works just as advertised. <---> Every </---> day players can log in and find a new randomized level to play some of which feature entirely new themes enemies or hazards. I loved that you can go back and replay old stages you've completed or any other previous level for that matter by unlocking them by way of a video ad. <---> While </---> some games that are ad-supported feel like a squeeze blowing through a short clip to play what could end up being a 10 to 15 minute stage (depending on how tough it is) is always worth it. Also yes every daily stage does have an end in case you were wondering which tabulates your total fruit collection percentage as a score of sorts. <---> There </---> comes a time where you've seen most of what the game can do but nearly every layout is competent at worst. Nitrome promises more updates though so there that. I also really like the setup and a lot .
