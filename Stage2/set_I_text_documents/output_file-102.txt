It really tough to describe a game like <+++> Agar. io </+++> [Free]. <---> It </---> hearkens back to the old age of computing back when Prodigy and <---> CompuServe </---> allowed users access to games at the cost of an hourly rate. There something soothing about the experience and since it free and gets right into the action in seconds you may as well try it out. <+++> Agar. io </+++> is described as an MMO but it a lot more arcade-like in nature. You'll start off as a single solitary cell -- yep as in a microscopic organism. Your objective is to simply absorb smaller cells grow in size and live as long as you possibly can. <---> If </---> you happen to get absorbed it game over and you'll start over from the beginning. I'm leaving out the major gimmick of course in that most of those other cells that you are eating and being eaten by are actually other players. Hence the massively multiplayer part. <---> As </---> you'd expect things can get extremely hectic and competitive being surrounded by a constant sea of players. To move about you'll simply flick about on-screen with the option to shoot out bits of your cell or split into two entities. You'll only want to do this after you absorb a few cells and it adds a bit more depth to the proceedings. <---> Also </---> there plenty of neutral areas to hide in but it always a gamble as there may be a bigger foe in there waiting to eat you. Again the premise is absurdly simplistic but there a lot of strategy at play. <---> The </---> reason <+++> Agar. io </+++> is so fun to play beyond the first few runs is because it has personality. Players can use emblems and phrases for their individual cells and it .
