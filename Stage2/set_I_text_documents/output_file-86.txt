I donât know about you guys but my favorite puzzle games are the ones that make me feel like a genius. Itâs an extremely delicate balance to achieve because if the puzzles are too easy it can feel boring. <---> If </---> theyâre too hard Iâm going to feel like an idiot. Somewhere in between those two ends of the spectrum is a sweet spot and it can be especially tricky to pinpoint since every person is different. <+++> Super Sharp </+++> [$1. 99] hits that sweet spot for me. <+++> Super Sharp </+++> by <---> 1Button </---> is an exceedingly clever little puzzle game that is incredibly easy to pick-up-and-play.

It may sound simple and at first it is. <---> Mechanically </---> all you have to do is drag your finger across the screen to âsliceâ and then let gravity do the rest similar to <+++> Icebreaker: A Viking Voyage </+++> [$0. 99]. Things quickly get complicated though as youâll soon be dealing with anti-gravity blocks spinning contraptions and colored shapes that must be matched to specific goal squares. Itâs actually incredibly impressive how different each level feels especially since there are over a hundred to solve. <---> For </---> an even greater challenge you can also try to get the âstarâ in each level by solving the puzzle in a limited number of moves. Actually it can be pretty helpful to check how many moves it takes to star a level since that can often give an idea of what youâre supposed to do. <---> For </---> example I was .
