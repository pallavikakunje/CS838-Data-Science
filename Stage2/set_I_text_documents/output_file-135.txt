The original <+++> Wind-Up Knight </+++> [Free] was a great game and a fine example of how platformers a genre many thought couldn't get along with touch controls can work just fine on mobiles provided they're designed properly around the hardware. <---> The </---> mechanic of constantly moving forward while asking you to manage jumps swings rolling and the shield gave you plenty to worry about without having to fuss around with a virtual directional pad and the game made sure to test your skills at all of those things to the hilt. It boasted tons of levels an assortment of collectibles and plenty of goals to shoot for during play. <---> It </---> also apparently struggled at its initial price because it was later retooled as a free-to-play experience albeit a fairly generous one since you could still unlock pretty much everything without paying a cent if you were skilled enough at the game. That probably why the sequel <+++> Wind-Up Knight 2 </+++> [Free] is launching as a free-to-play game. <---> At </---> least that what it initially seems like but in actuality it turns out to be more of a demo with an IAP unlock for the full game. <---> The </---> initial free download covers the first eight story levels along with giving you access to the endless tournament mode with the rest of the story levels available to purchase in one lump sum. The way this IAP works is kind of interesting since the game will offer it to you at a discount if you make the purchase within 30 minutes of receiving the message. The price has already changed once from $3. 99 to $1. 99 with the non-impulse price set at $8. 99 initially but now set at $4. 99. <---> This </---> could change again so don't take these prices as gospel. .
