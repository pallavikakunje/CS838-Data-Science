I admit that I'm coming into this <+++> Anomaly Defenders </+++> [$4. 99] with a bit of bias because I've played each of the <+++> Anomaly </+++> games. I liked the games but I'm hardly a raving fanatic for the series. But still it hard not to play this and think that this is kind of fan service for people have played the previous games in the series and wonder what it would be like to play as the aliens defending from the humans. <---> Well </---> let me just say â it turns out 11 bit is as good at tower defense as they are at tower offense. The premise really is flipped from <+++> Anomaly 2 </+++> [$4. 99]: now it time to defend towers from the invading humans using many of the same units familiarized in earlier games with humans using the exact same rules and mechanics from when they were under your control. <---> This </---> means that <+++> Anomaly Defenders </+++> is a far more traditional game than the previous <+++> Anomaly </+++> titles because it is your standard fixed-path tower defense but there are several reasons why the game stands out. One is that the game has so many varied level designs. <---> The </---> main-line <+++> Anomaly </+++> games had plenty of twisty paths and while this game perhaps doesn't get as nutty in terms of how its levels are laid out it does manage to introduce a great number of designs that are far more complex than most tower defense games. It leads to some challenging missions and ones that aren't afraid to take a longer time to play than many mobile tower defense games. <---> Second </---> is the game fantastic upgrade and progression system. Beating a level at a certain difficulty nets a certain number of technology points .
