Originally released on the Mac PC and Linux machines in late 2012 <+++> FTL: Faster Than Light </+++> [$9. 99 (HD)] has seen more positive reviews and won more awards than I can even reasonably list. Rocking a solid 86 on Metacritic FTL has already proven itself to be a great game. If you missed all the buzz the first time around here the <---> gist-The </---> premise surrounds around you being in control of a ship from the Galactic Federation carrying vital data and running from the rebel fleet who are on your tail. <---> The </---> game ends when you get the data to the Federation HQ but of course that significantly easier said than done. <---> Getting </---> there in one piece involved seemingly endless combat situations with hostile ships trading space scrap for new weapons crew members and ship upgrades deciding when to use diplomacy and when to fire up your weapons and much much more. The depth of the game is incredible and while jumping from point to point as your FTL drive spools up can feel slow paced when the you-know-what hits the fan FTL gets insanely hectic. <---> Your </---> ship has several core systems ranging from its engine the shields weapons array door controls sensors and more. In a fight enemies can (and will) end up disabling systems making things exponentially more crazy. <---> For </---> instance when you take damage and parts of your ship catch fire it seems the best way to take care of it is tricky airlock management to vent oxygen from those areas out in to space and in the process put out the fires. Closing the doors again re-pressurizes those areas the fire is gone and you're good to go. <---> If </---> you lose your sensors and you've got a fire onboard you won't be able to .
