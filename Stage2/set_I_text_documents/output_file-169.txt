<+++> Deep Under The Sky </+++> [$3. 99] is a really fascinating game that winds up being a game that really fun to play â it has a variety of things to do that are enjoyable to play with in motion the game is set up to not be frustrating to play and it makes a lot of its premise by presenting tricky challenges to solve. It does so well at so many things that while calling a physics-based puzzle-platformer is perhaps the closest approximation of a descriptor for the game it got appeal beyond just what those words mean â and it just so gorgeous and well-made that it worth checking out no matter what. <---> The </---> goal of any given level is to launch baby jellyfish from a single starting point then using a few different abilities to help plant them at the various points throughout the levels trying to do so in as few launches as possible as quickly as possible and while collecting both of the optional stars in the level. Oh and everything is done with single taps. <---> There </---> are three basic mechanics that come into play: midair acceleration dropping and rolling and launching a grappling hook to swing from. I'm not going to lie â once I saw that in the trailer for the game I was immediately entranced. I've loved grappling hooks in games from <+++> Super Metroid </+++> to Rocketcat <+++> Super QuickHook </+++> [$2. 99] et al. <---> And </---> this game has a cool use of swinging mechanics: the hook fires out in a set direction per level including sometimes downward which requires some different approaches to a thing I love to do in games. <---> This </---> goes for the boosts too â some levels have them be in set directions and others in .
