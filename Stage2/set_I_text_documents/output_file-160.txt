Radiangames â perhaps the most prolific creator of dual-stick shooters on the <---> App Store </---> - has made their biggest one yet with their latest release <+++> Inferno 2 </+++> [$2. 99]. Seriously <+++> Inferno 2 </+++> is massive: 80 levels full of mazes tens of thousands of enemies to take down four different weapons to use four different missiles (inspired by the special weapons of <+++> <html><body><a href=http://toucharcade. com/2014/05/19/joyjoy-review/>JoyJoy</a></body></html> </+++> [$1. 99]) a level-up system and loads of upgrades to use. <---> This </---> game is vast and it a great pickup for fans of Radiangames' previous work or anyone looking for an action game to sink a few hours into. <+++> Inferno 2 </+++> doesn't really surprise in any way. The game not dissimilar from the original <+++> Inferno+ </+++> [$1. 99] in that it a level-based dual-stick shooter. <---> Levels </---> are about navigating waves of enemies collecting keys to open up locks finding secret passages to get more credits collecting experience to upgrade weapons and missiles and so on. There the occasional survival mission boss battle and core destroyer level to mix things up too. <---> But </---> considering that Radiangames has made a bunch of these games before â heck <+++> Powerpuff Girls: Defenders of Townsville </+++> [$3. 99] was pretty much a dual-stick shooter dressed up as a <---> Metroidvania </---> game â and it uses that familiar abstract art style it hard to say this game contains any surprises. It just 80 levels of action. <+++> Inferno 2 </+++> got 2 different weapons systems to use and switch between and I think it could certainly be simplified. I'd like the option to just have say one or two weapons and missiles to swap between as that what I typically used: for weapons I used the spread and the reflex shots. For missiles .
