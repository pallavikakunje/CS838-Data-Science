It was just over a year ago that I reviewed Douglas Cowley excellent strategy game <+++> Hoplite </+++> [$2. 99]. I found it to be a superb game as many did with tremendous depth and not an ounce of fat on its bones. It one of the most efficiently-designed mobile games I've ever played. I can't say for sure if <+++> Mucho Party </+++> [Free] developer GlobZ was inspired by <+++> Hoplite </+++> when they made their latest game <+++> Lamp And Vamp </+++> [$1. 99] but it sure feels like they were. <---> Not </---> in a bad way mind you. <+++> Lamp And Vamp </+++> certainly feels familiar but it different enough that it doesn't feel superfluous.

You'll even get a little health replenished for your troubles. <---> In </---> addition to feeding on your .
