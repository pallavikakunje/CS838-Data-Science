Take a look at the screenshots for <+++> Lines the Game </+++>Â [$2. 99]. <---> Go </---> ahead Iâll wait. Pretty lame right? I mean itâs a bunch of empty basic shapes on a white background. Iâve seen sweaters that looked more fun to play. Heck even the name is painfully uninspired. âLinesâ huh? <---> Oh </---> and itâs a âGameâ? You donât say. <---> How </---> about I pour myself a glass of warm water and prepare a big olâ bowl of lettuce âcause â <+++> Lines the Game </+++>â is here and we need to celebrate this. <---> Well </---> the jokeâs on me (as is often the case) because Gamiousâ new game is actually shockingly great. In fact Iâd go so far as to say itâs my favorite puzzle game at the moment. Itâs brilliant satisfying supremely relaxing and--to borrow an amusingly awkward phrase from the literary world--unputdownable. SoâŚ what is it?Iâm not sure that describing the game is going to be any more enticing than the screenshots are but Iâll do my best. <---> Each </---> level presents you with a simple picture made up of--you guessed it--lines. There are various colored dots on these lines and your job is to manipulate the dots (or later the lines themselves) to make sure your color covers more of the picture than the other colors do. <---> The </---> first mode youâll play is called âPointâ (they really have a way with words donât they?). Youâre tasked with placing a dot (or a series of dots) anywhere along the lines of the image and when youâre finished a sort of âraceâ starts between the different colors. Each dot expands outward along the lines at the same pace and eventually all of the lines are filled in. <---> Your </---> color is always indicated at the edges of the screen so as long as thereâs .
