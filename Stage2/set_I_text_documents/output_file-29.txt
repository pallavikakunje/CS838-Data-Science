Have you played <+++> Lifeline </+++>? <---> It </---> came out in 2015 and had a very clever concept: it turned one of the primary purposes of a phone - sending and receiving messages - into a game. The game had you talking to a survivor of a spaceship crash and you couldn't do anything but advise him all the while trying to keep him alive. <---> At </---> its core <+++> Lifeline </+++> was a choose-your-own-adventure game but its use of real-time messaging as the main game mechanic made the game feel more like a real-life communication rather than a spreadsheet of choices and consequences. As much as it tried to imitate real life though <+++> Lifeline </+++> was a bit too stilted the communication never really tricking you into believing that the person on the other side of the fictional line was a real human being. <+++> Mr. Robot: 1. 51exfilitrati0n </+++>Â [$2. 99] uses a similar gimmick to <+++> Lifeline </+++>; you find a phone on the ground that uses a new messaging app and then you use the capabilities of that app to communicate with people and perform all kinds of - mostly-insidious - tasks. <---> Where </---> <+++> Mr. Robot </+++> stands out though is in the way it succeeds in making the player suspend disbelief. Communicating with the rest of the people in the game feels like talking to real people the kind that use internet-speak fluently and the kind you probably chat with every day. <---> Through </---> this faithful simulation of contemporary communicationÂ and through some other simple - yet clever - tricks <+++> Mr. Robot </+++> managed to draw me into its paranoid world even though - or maybe because - it barely gives any background info on theÂ worldÂ I wasÂ inhabiting other than a quick video at the start of the game. .
