More than ever before a game review these days is often little more than a snapshot of a work in progress. <---> Developers </---> are rarely finished with games just because they've launched and in certain cases so much is added after the fact that whatever I thought at a game release no longer fits terribly well. A fine example of that is <+++> Demon Rise </+++> [$7. 99] the debut SRPG from developer <---> Wave Light </---> Games. Wave Light worked hard on balancing the game adding lots of content and implementing features taking it far beyond what was in the initial release. <---> In </---> fact the developer recently updated it again and will be doing more in the future. It great but it also presents something of a challenge when it comes to a follow-up. <---> Depending </---> on which version of <+++> Demon Rise </+++> you played <+++> Demon Rise 2 </+++> [$7. 99] is either miles beyond it or a lateral step. It only been just over a year since the first game came out but <---> Wave Light </---> has learned a great deal in that time and poured all of that knowledge into making the first game the best that it can be. <+++> Demon Rise 2 </+++> benefits from all of those lessons learned and as a result is launching in essentially the state that the first game achieved after a year of feedback and improvements. It addresses nearly every issue I pointed in out in my review of the first game because well the developer has already addressed those through updates to <+++> Demon Rise </+++>. If you were to play both games in the series now you wouldn't find a lot of differences in the mechanics but that doesn't mean that this isn't an excellent sequel. <---> Allowing </---> that the nuts .
