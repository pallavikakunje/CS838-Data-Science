I dont usually prejudge games before playing them but I would be lying if I said I didnt get excited by the sheer mention of a new Rocketcat game. <+++> Five Card Quest </+++>[$2. 99] is that game and it is cool + awesome. <---> Even </---> though it could be described as a Card Battler/Tactical RPG/Roguelike it doesn't play like a hybrid game. <---> It </---> is a sleek and challenging dungeon delver that really stresses making the right decision and playing the right card each turn. The point of <+++> Five Card Quest </+++> is to beat the bad guys and get your stalwart band out of the various labrynthine dungeon levels they find themselves in hacking and slashing and shooting and casting all along the way. <---> The </---> game pits your team against roving bands of miscreants and ne'erdowells that are trying their best to destroy you. Your team stands across three lanes of combat ready to unleash devastation against bad guys that all have attack patterns that can be learned and anticipated so as to reduce incoming damage and maximize outgoing damage. <---> Each </---> hero you can choose from(you get your choice of 2 at the start) has their own deck of cards that get shuffled together with the other members of your team. At the beginning of combat you are dealt a hand of cards that is mixed between each class. <---> There </---> are a wide variety of defensive offensive and utility skill cards for each class. A solid understanding of these cards is the backbone to success in FCQ. <---> Once </---> you know what each class is capable of and what types of cards you need in a given situation discarding buying extra turns and mitigating damage all become very important tools you can learn to use to alter the course of .
