The flexibility of topics in the interactive fiction genre is one of its greatest strengths. I've said this before but due to the relatively low production costs of putting words on a page interactive fiction can take risks that other games dare not. <---> Thankfully </---> nearly every company releasing gamebooks isn't shy about flexing that privilege. The occasional release even goes for comedy a fairly hard topic to do well in gaming. <---> Earlier </---> this year we had the absolutely delightful <+++> Ryan North To Be Or Not To Be </+++> [$4. 99] from Tin Man Games and now from <---> Choice Of Games </---> and author Nick Aires we have the madcap super-villain simulator <+++> Diabolical </+++> [Free]. I'm feeling a little bit spoiled to be honest. <---> Simply </---> put <+++> Diabolical </+++> is both a lot of fun and very well-written. You play as a new super-villain taking up the role just as you're robbing your first bank. <---> While </---> you're strictly small-time at the start you soon attract the attention of some superheroes and perhaps more troublingly some very big super-villains. Each chapter increases the stakes alongside the outlandishness of your crimes culminating in a tug-of-war for the very <---> Earth </---> itself. It a smooth consistent progression that moves at exactly the right pace. <---> Best </---> of all you can choose what kind of villain you'd like to be. Are you the pragmatic planner that lurks in the background letting your henchman do all the work? <---> Or </---> do you prefer to get your hands dirty by doing jobs yourself? Are you a killer or a negotiator? <---> Are </---> you in it for political reasons or are you just a creature of chaos? It all up to you and the choices you make as the story unfolds. <---> Similarly </---> you control to a great degree who your friends .
