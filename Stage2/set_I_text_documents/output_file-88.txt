Iâll admit I was a bit dismissive when I first saw the trailer for Jutiful AZZL [$2. 99]. I mean sure it looks really well made and has a neat idea at its core butâŚ it just seems like a childrenâs game. Ultimately though I couldnât resist the the promise of a colorful relaxing puzzler and dove in. But should I review it? Would the intelligent and discerning (and quite good looking) readers of this esteemed mobile review site even be interested in something like this? I think they might be and I hope youâll (theyâll?) allow me to spend the next seven paragraphs explaining why. Basically AZZL is a puzzle game. And by that I mean itâs a jigsaw puzzle game.

It may sound a lot more dumbed down that a traditional physical puzzle but it works really well and keeps things suitably quick and simple. <---> The </---> other thing that sets it apart from a jigsaw puzzle is that youâre not working with a single picture thatâs been broken up into pieces; rather youâre actually putting a looping animation together (sort of like the newspapers in the Harry Potter movies. . . . <---> And </---> books?

Effectively it means that each piece is actually a small fragment of a little cartoon that plays over and over and it can be surprisingly challenging trying to line these fragments up since they keep changing.
