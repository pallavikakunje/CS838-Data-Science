<+++> Space Marshals </+++> [$3. 99] is not the dual-stick shooter you probably were expecting â at least not as a mobile game. This is a slow-burning tactical shooter eschewing the typical fast-paced high-score-obsessed affairs that many dual-stick shooters try to be. <---> Instead </---> this is about stealth and using sounds to distract enemies and trying to avoid wild firefights as much as possible. And it from a company known for racing games. <---> Yet </---> <+++> Space Marshals </+++> does a lot right including with its reward-based loot system. This is the first episode of a series and there plenty to look forward to from this game though there a solid amount of game here already. <---> You </---> play as the eponymous space marshal who has to hunt down escaped criminals in a futuristic wild west setting and bring them to justice. In this case justice means shoot them dead because you can't trust fugitive space criminals who have already escaped once. <---> The </---> game is stealth-centric in part because enemies can deal large amounts of damage to you so your primary mode of operation is to switch from offensive mode to the quiet and crouching stealth mode getting behind cover to avoid fire and to help pick off enemies before they notice you. Doing so also grants a damage bonus. <---> You </---> get two weapons one smaller gun and one bigger gun such as a shotgun or distanced rifle and two projectile weapons. There are grenades and throwing axes but also rocks. <---> Why </---> go with rocks? Well they can be used to distract enemies and get them off of your scent. <---> The </---> enemies are not the smartest but they can do plenty of damage. There are plenty of health and armor pickups ammo can be refilled often and it possible to respawn from each .
