I'm frequently impressed at how quickly some small developers can create a game. It hasn't even been a year since the original <+++> Mazes Of Karradash </+++> [$0. 99] released and here I am looking at an impressively large-scale sequel. The fundamentals of the game haven't changed much in <+++> Mazes Of Karradash 2 </+++> [$1. 99] but everything is bigger brighter and more advanced. Whereas I tended to think of the first game as a lightweight RPG best fit for filling in short gaps of time the sequel has become something you'll want to settle into a comfy chair to play. <---> Once </---> again you play as a hero who is exploring the dungeons of Karradash. This time around there are 20 floors to romp around in. <---> That </---> fewer than the first game 25 but don't go thinking the game is shorter. Each of those floors is significantly larger than the ones in the first game. <---> Even </---> the first floor is impressive in its size. The designs are completely fixed this time around so everyone will be playing the same layouts no matter which character they're using. <---> What </---> that possibly costs the game in replay value it more than makes up for by allowing the developer to design the details of each floor. There are more puzzles more interesting nooks and crannies and more tough boss-level monsters. <---> You </---> might even want to bust out your graph paper on this one. While the venues are bigger the gameplay is quite familiar. You'll roll your character visit the town to pick up anything you might need head into the maze and try to find the exit on each floor. You'll run into enemies both as invisible random encounters and as fixed battles marked by a floating skull with yellow denoting a powerful .
