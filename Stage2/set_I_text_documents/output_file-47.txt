Some of you may remember from previous reviews of mine that I love horror and dark fantasy. Everything from <---> Lovecraftian </---> anti-existentialism to tastefully done psychological horror to torture porn to â2Edgy4Uâ bull-crap. I find something to enjoy in all of it. I also love simple stories of heroes and hope and overcoming hardships donât get me wrong. I thoroughly enjoy the darkest depths and the brightest heights of the human imagination. WellâŚ if any one living author and any particular story represents those darkest depths itâs <---> Harlan Ellison </---> and his story and point and click adventure game <+++> I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream </+++> [$3. 99]. Despite all my horror âcredâ Iâve never read or played this old school tale. I just never got around to it but the unfortunate people whoâve come to know the twisted landscape of my mind have gushed in recommending this story and game to me. When I saw that it was available on iOS I downloaded the game and short story collection immediately! And then it went on the back burner for another couple months. <---> Having </---> finally delved into both and also reading discussions and analyses of each I am so glad I played this classic. It was well worth it. <---> Probably </---> the most well known story of Ellisonâs IHNMAIMS (in-maims) is a short and horrifying read from 1967. <---> Despite </---> being less than 20 pages it is so full of vivid horrifying ideas and imagery that it really sticks with you. The quintessential story of a fate worse than death. <---> Heck </---> itâs even the trope namer of that exact concept on TV Tropes called âAnd I Must Screamâ [DONâT CLICK THAT LINK IF YOU DONâT WANT SPOILERS]. <---> If </---> our forums have taught me anything itâs that this game is criminally under-known. .
