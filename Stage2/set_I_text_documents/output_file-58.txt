The original <+++> 9th Dawn </+++> [$2. 99] was released almost three years ago. <---> It </---> didn't look like much but as long as you could get past the humble presentation you would have found an open world action-RPG with a scale few other <---> iOS </---> games can match. It had a clunky user interface and for those who prefer a more guided experience with their <---> RPGs </---> its old-school nature could be off-putting. Personally I loved the game as it brought back fond memories of fumbling around in games like <+++> Ultima </+++> and the lack of explicit story-telling was often made up for by the provocative world design. <---> The </---> sequel <+++> 9th Dawn 2 </+++> [$3. 99] has a few useful changes to address issues with the the original game but for all intents and purposes this is another heaping plate of the same taste. If you couldn't get enough of the first you can throw down your money without fear. <+++> 9th Dawn 2 </+++> won't let you down. <+++> 9th Dawn 2 </+++> is like the first game an open world action RPG. <---> You </---> can choose from three job classes at the start and after a short tutorial you'll find yourself in a little town. Your first quest is lined up for you and in case you can't find your way along the short path to the cave you need to go to an NPC is waiting to lead you there. You can go in and complete that first quest or you can just wander off and do your own thing. <---> That </---> about as much guidance as you're going to get in the game and for anyone unaccustomed to that kind of hands-off design it can be a little overwhelming just as it was in the first game.
