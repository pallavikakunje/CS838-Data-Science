There been a resurgence of games featuring tofu in the past year or so but not all of them are necessarily worth checking out. Naturally I gravitated towards a recent release called <+++> To-Fu Fury </+++> [$0. 99] featuring piece of ninja tofu. I mean when have ninjas ever let me down right? <---> While </---> you won't be running on rooftops and taking down rival daimyos in epic combat you will be flinging yourself across the screen and collecting pieces of Chi. It more of a zen-like ninja experience and that completely fine with me given how great the control scheme is. <---> All </---> of it is done by way of touch where you can move your piece of tofu about in three different ways. The most basic means of movement is by way of flinging which is done by tapping your character and aiming in any direction on the screen. <---> It </---> very simple but multi-faceted as your tofu will actually stretch out depending on how far you aim which will allow him to push objects with his head. Another form of movement is walking which is done by placing two fingers on the screen in any direction. <---> Lastly </---> you can fling yourself in a curved fashion by holding down your finger on the tofu itself and steadying your aim on your character. Because of these three mechanics levels can be fairly open-ended and unique with new concepts popping up constantly. <---> For </---> instance many stages require you to master all three types of movement with challenges like walking on moving wheels to aim a perfect shot and triggering Rube Goldberg-esque contraptions to roll balls into obstacles. <---> It </---> walks a fine line between frantic and methodical and the bigger your screen real estate is on your device the more room you'll have to .
