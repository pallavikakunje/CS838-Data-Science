They say that you should dress for the job you want not the job you have. <---> Which </---> is exactly why whenever I write reviews I wear my furry Chewbacca bath robe. <---> You </---> don't get quite as disparate or quite as wide of a gap as a lowly beggar literally wearing the face of god and getting godlike power in the process. That quite the promotion! <---> And </---> it also the premise of the lovely puzzle platformer and debut App Store game from <---> Bad Seed </---> <+++> The Beggar Ride </+++>[$3. 99]. With its spiritual themes soft 3D art style and interesting powers I was immediately reminded of 2012 mobile and <---> WiiWare </---> titles <+++> LostWinds </+++>[$3. 99] and <+++> LostWinds2: Winter of Melodias </+++>[$3. 99]. I think the developers were likely inspired by these games too. <---> They </---> have similar pacing a similar tone and similar relaxing yet occasionally frustrating gameplay. Playing as the titular beggar one day you happen upon the resting place of a god. A strange land floating in the sky with religious iconography and temples littered about. You also find a mask which gives you the godlike power to move the clouds in the sky and create rain. <---> Before </---> long you find more masks. These masks fold into one single mask and increase your power set. <---> The </---> second mask lets you tilt the level to affect gravity and slide things about. The third lets you slide special pieces of ground along designated paths. <---> The </---> fourth and final mask lets you control the sun and moon in the sky switching between day and night at will. You can also shoot beams of light from the sun and cycle through the phases of the lunar cycle. <---> Whenever </---> you put the mask on everything becomes illuminated and golden with interactive objects highlighted in .
