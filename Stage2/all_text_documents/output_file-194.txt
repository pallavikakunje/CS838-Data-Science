<+++> Tony Hawk Pro Skater </+++> back on the original PlayStation was something of a revelation for me as a gamer. <---> See </---> up until that point I generally avoided games whose themes I had little interest in. If I didn't like watching or playing football why would I like <+++> Madden </+++>? If I didn't like 7up surely <+++> Cool Spot </+++> would not appeal to me. <---> So </---> having little interest in skateboarding I paid little attention to THPS until a friend pretty much forced me to try it. It quickly became one of my favorite games and I became an avid fan of the series until it tragically asphyxiated itself with a giant skateboard accessory. All that without knowing anything about skateboarding other than that I was really lousy at it. After that I started to be considerably more open-minded about what I played and that never a bad thing. <---> The </---> connection <+++> SuperPro Snowboarding </+++> [Free] has to <+++> Tony Hawk </+++> is then twofold for me. Like skateboarding I have very little knowledge or interest in real snowboarding. I played <+++> Coolboarders </+++> and <+++> 1080 Snowboarding </+++> along with a couple of more forgettable games but the fine sport of snowboarding is not typically my thing. <---> Apart </---> from that personal link a lot of <+++> SuperPro Snowboarding </+++> is clearly informed by the <+++> Tony Hawk </+++> games hitting many of the same great notes even while making a fairly major shift to a 2D plane. <---> Making </---> that move it also hits me how much <+++> Tony Hawk </+++> was something of a 3D version of another old favorite classic of mine DMA Design <+++> Uniracers </+++> for the SNES because there are definite echoes of that fine game in here as well. <+++> SuperPro Snowboarding .
