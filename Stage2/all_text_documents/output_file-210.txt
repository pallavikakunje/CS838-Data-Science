Going back and playing the first <+++> Cally Caves </+++> game it stunning how far this series has come in such a short span of time. <---> While </---> the core action gameplay is solid just about everything else in the game looks and feels well like the small indie game that it is. <+++> Cally Caves 2 </+++> [Free] upped the ante significantly not just in terms of presentation but also in gameplay mechanics adding a compelling <+++> Ratchet & Clank </+++>-style weapon upgrade system and smoothing out the overall difficulty. A quick glance at <+++> Cally Caves 3 </+++> [Free] would make you think you're getting more of the same from the second game but although the game may not appear all that different at first I'm going to go as far as to say that this third game represents almost as significant a leap over <+++> Cally Caves 2 </+++> as that game had made over the original. <---> The </---> story set-up is familiar and the game makes no attempt to hide that. Cally parents have been kidnapped by the evil Dr. <---> Herbert </---> and it up to our gun- and sword-wielding heroine to rescue them. You'll once again enter the cave system in Cally backyard and the mysterious musician <---> Lloyd </---> is back again to give his advice. There are 120 levels in the game in total which in pure numbers is slightly higher than the second game 110 levels but the stages also tend to be bigger than the ones found in the previous game making for a much longer adventure overall. <---> The </---> weapon count is as robust as ever with 12 different weapons that can be upgraded and modified to your heart content. You can also find other power-ups for <---> Cally </---> including a triple-jump a roll and a swimming .
