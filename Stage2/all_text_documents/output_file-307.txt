In <+++> Pocket Frogs </+++> as the title may suggest you are responsible for breeding growing and maintaining a habitat (or eventually multiple habitats) of cute little frogs. <---> The </---> process goes a little something like this: Tapping a frog brings up a menu initially you have the option to move the frog to another habitat take the frog out to the pond or just sell the frog for coins. <---> Usually </---> you will want to take frogs to the pond which consists of a quasi-exploration mini-game where you hop around on lily pads somewhat similar to <+++> Dizzypad </+++> [$1. 99 / HD].

You can breed it (more on that later). <---> You </---> can catalog it which allows you to essentially re-order a frog in the in-game mail if you sell it or need another one. Finally you can gift the frog to any friend via the Plus+ network. <---> At </---> any time you can take any of your frogs back to the pond which will allow them to fill up on dragonflies to increase their happiness. In addition you will randomly stumble across presents which could be an additional frog new backgrounds or objects for your habitat coins or the various in-game consumables. <---> Also </---> there are other frogs bouncing about the pond which you will run in to and when you jump to the same lilly pad you have the option to breed with said frog. Initially breeding frogs seems fairly simple but as you progress further in to the game it actually gets quite complex. <---> Basically </---> frogs have three traits: Their base color their pattern color and the pattern itself. <---> When </---> you breed two .
