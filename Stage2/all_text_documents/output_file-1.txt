The first thing that drew my attention to <+++> Slayaway Camp </+++> [$2. 99] was the horror theme. <---> Designed </---> as a pastiche of 1980s horror in all its cheesy glory combined with a voxel look that allowed for some gory slasher action with a comical feel. And then the game released on <---> Steam </---> first. After some work to make the game acceptable for <---> Apple </---> we finally have <+++> Slayaway Camp </+++> on mobile and what I found wasn't just a game that was over-the-top in gore and humor. I also found a great sliding puzzle game that also managed to integrate its theme in a masterful way. This is a game that fun to play and experience the little world it has created. <---> At </---> its heart <+++> Slayaway Camp </+++> is a sliding puzzle game just with a macabre twist. You control the killer in a horror movie trying to both take out all the victims in the level and then make it to the portal back to hell that opens up once all victims are dead. <---> In </---> your way are your typical sliding puzzle hazards such as spots that can only be reached in particular moments like when you kill a victim which stops you in place. Cops and SWAT units will take you out if you get in range unless you take them out in a particular way. Water holes and fire will kill you but they'll also kill your victims. <+++> Slayaway Camp </+++> might let you kill campers to your heart content but cats are off limits. <---> But </---> they can't escape either you just have to make sure they stay out of your way. <+++> Slayaway Camp </+++> does an exemplary job at combining all these elements over time into the puzzles. Everything is steadily introduced .
