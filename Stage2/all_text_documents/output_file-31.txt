Pixelbite got a lot right with the first <+++> Space Marshals </+++> [$3. 99]. <---> They </---> eschewed much of what is common in dual-stick shooters on mobile going with a slower more thoughtful stealth-based game. With an array of interesting weaponry and tactics at your disposal such as using noisemakers to distract enemies to take them out away from the prying eyes of other enemies it was a cool concept and a fun game. <---> The </---> controls were great for mobile with MFi controller support and <---> iCloud </---> to boot. It was not a perfect game but a great example of how to make an original stylish title for mobile. <---> Plus </---> they updated the game with 2 new episodes months after launch. <+++> Space Marshals 2 </+++> [$4. 99] returns and basically is the same game streamlined with a couple new features and skipping on the whole episodic aspect to give you 20 beefy levels of tactical stealth action in a space wild-west setting. And like any sequel where iteration is the key difference it not bad â this is the superior game â but the lack of surprise can be a bit disappointing. <---> If </---> you need to know about the core of the game go read my <+++> Space Marshals 1 </+++> review and come back here. Okay. What differentiates <+++> Space Marshals 2 </+++> from the original is that you can now execute stealth kills. <---> Walk </---> up behind an enemy while in crouched mode and you can kill them though it takes a few seconds so if you're spotted and shot by other enemies it'll cancel out the kill. Still this goes a long way to actually make the game feel like stealth is a key part of the game because you have a way to be stealthy without making noise. .
