For a while now I've been worn out on free-to-play sims. <+++> Tiny Tower </+++> [Free] and <+++> Dragonvale </+++> [Free] devoured my waking hours (and my phone battery) but then I grew listless. What the point I thought in clicking stuff to earn coins that just let you click more stuff? <+++> Pixel People </+++> [Free] has reminded me of something fundamental: it not the point that matters it the fun along the way. LambdaMu Games has distilled everything I love about the freemium sim formula into one incredibly potent brew. It doesn't require an ounce of skill but building a new society from the genetic matter of earth is a great way to pass the time. <---> It </---> the joy of discovery you see. You start with a couple of jobs for your clonesâmechanic and mayor. <---> You </---> stick them together and a third option comes out: engineer. Your new engineer has a name (something punny) cute pixel art and a quip about his imposed career. <---> Then </---> you wonder hmm what would happen if I matched up my engineer with my mayor? <---> That </---> when I knew they had me. <---> If </---> that were all there were to <+++> Pixel People </+++> we'd have ourselves a low-end <+++> Doodle God </+++> [$1. 99]. It not even a challenge really since the game shows you which jobs have viable combinations available. <---> Poke </---> through the list until you find something new and pow a minute or two later and you'll be rewarded with an exciting new job revelation and a host of new combos. No it the city building that turns this into something that will eat your life. <---> Many </---> of the new jobs require new workplaces. So you get your engineer and in turn he gives you the plans for a <---> Utopium Mine </---> which .
