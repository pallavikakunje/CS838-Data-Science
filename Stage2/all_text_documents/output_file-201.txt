I feel like as a developer you can go broke attending conferences buying books and listening to seminars on how to make the perfect game when in my eyes it has always come down to simplicity. <---> The </---> best most universally loved games on the App Store with rare exception check these three <---> boxes:Greg Wohlwend </---> and Asher Vollmer <+++> Threes! </+++> [$2. 99] does all this and more. <---> Here </---> your single-sentence premise: Slide blocks to combine factors of three. <---> It </---> a concept so simple that upon initial inspection you find yourself wondering how such a thing could even be more compelling than learning multiplication tables but oh how wrong you would be. As exhibited by this similarly simple gif things get tricky <---> quick:So </---> as you can see the basic idea here is you take a 1 block and a 2 block mash 'em together and end up with a 3 block. Do that to create another 6 block mash those two 6 blocks together and end up with a 12 block. Repeat. <---> The </---> clever part here is that when you swipe you're not just moving one block at a time instead you're moving all the blocks together. Blocks slide if they can combine if they can or just stay stuck where they are if there four blocks in a row that can't move over. <---> Much </---> like the turn-based roguelike <+++> Hoplite </+++> these incredibly simple mechanics combine into something truly wonderful and predictable if only you possess the mental fortitude to predict it. Games of <+++> Threes! </+++> quickly escalate to an epic dance of block management as much like the classic puzzlers we grew up on you're given a hint of what coming next in the form of a red 2 block a blue 1 block or a white numbered .
