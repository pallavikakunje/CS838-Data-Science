Dying alone in space doesnât seem so bad now that Iâve played <+++> Out There </+++> [$1. 99] from <---> Mi Clos </---> Studio. Iâve exploded a few times been stranded without fuel a few dozen and suffocated on at least one occasion. On the way thoughâŚ <---> On </---> the way I discovered the mysteries of the universe. <+++> Out There </+++> might look a bit like say FTL in the right light but itâs a different breed of game. Itâs about desperately managing resources making careful choices and suffering their consequences. Itâs about exploration and being terribly terribly alone. Itâs not at all about space combat and thatâs entirely okay. Its premise sees you lost in space with a little ship and a heck of a long trip home. Youâve gone off path under cryogenic sleep and youâre nowhere near Earth. <---> You </---> have the technology to jump between solar systems though. With that you begin a mission to get home. <---> That </---> mission shakes out differently every time you play. At its base <+++> Out There </+++> is all about resource and risk management. <---> You </---> can exploit the planets you find for their resources and those resources give you fuel oxygen and hull strength. Run out of any of those three things and itâs game over. <---> You </---> tap your way through solar systems and on and off of identical planets. You drag elements around to fuel your ship and destroy anything that takes up precious space but doesn't pull its weight. <---> While </---> youâre getting the hang of it your decisions revolve around which resources to risk to get others. Each time you eke out a profit in hydrogen or iron you drag out your survival a little longer. <---> You </---> score a little higher on the leaderboard maybe finding your way to a clever .
