There are two things I know when I fire up a new game from <---> Michael </---> Brough. One its presentation is probably not going to win any awards. <---> Two </---> I'm going to have a good time. Brough got a talent for designing games whose gracefully skate the line between accessibility and depth. 868-HACK [$4. 99] is the kind of game that should probably be on everyone mobile device. I'm sure it isn't but it ought to be. His latest game is <+++> Imbroglio </+++> [$3. 99] and while it clearly another spin on the single-screen strategy trappings that comprise many of <---> Brough </---> offerings it is a clever one. It has a similar appeal to 868-HACK but throws in a few interesting twists for your brain to chew on. In <+++> Imbroglio </+++> you take one of several characters into a dungeon. <---> There </---> are doors in the corners that will occasionally let a monster in and you'll obviously want to watch out for those. The goal is to collect the purple star that appears at which point the walls of the dungeon will be reset you'll regain a point or two of damage and the star will relocate to another spot. <---> You </---> need to gather as many stars as possible before your inevitable death. Besides the ever-changing walls the main gimmick is that your attacks and skills are determined by where your character is standing. <---> Each </---> space on the dungeon board has a piece of gear attached to it that you can use to fend off the monsters. As you kill enemies the gear on the squares will level up with various effects. You'll also earn runes that allow you to use your character special ability. <---> The </---> gear pieces come in two general types physical and magical each dealing damage to either .
