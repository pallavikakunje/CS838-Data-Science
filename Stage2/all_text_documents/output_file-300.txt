The match three section is arguably the most overstuffed virtual aisle of the <---> App Store </---> second only to <+++> Doodle </+++> games and more recently <+++> Angry Birds </+++> knock-offs. Regardless developers keep making them I keep trying them and rarely do I find one that I'd play over match three staples like <+++> Bejeweled 2 </+++> [99Â˘]. <+++> Dungeon Raid </+++> [$2. 99] is a rare exception to this as it not only has solid matching gameplay with a clever twist but it also has entirely too many things that I like in video games making it incredibly hard to put down. <+++> Dungeon Raid </+++> begins with you inputting your character name and selecting a difficulty. Don't worry if you can't come up with a good name the game will suggest tons of random names that fit wonderfully in to any fantasy setting. From there you're greeted with one of several random introductions to the game explaining how it is that your character has come across this dungeon. <---> These </---> intros are awesome so I highly recommend actually reading them instead of instinctively mashing buttons to make large blocks of text go away. (I think we're all guilty of this on some level. )The matching component of the game is quite similar to <+++> Azkend </+++> [$2. 99 / Lite] <---> (Which </---> is another fantastic matching game. ) in that instead of swapping pieces around like <+++> Bejeweled </+++> you draw chains of similar blocks with your finger. These chains can go any direction including diagonally often resulting in massive board clearing matches. <---> In </---> fact with only five types of blocks huge chains are quite common. By now you might be scratching your head wondering why I'm piling shovels full of praise on to a matching game with a matching .
