No developer out there is so quick to buck trends and make risky imaginative original titles like Simogo. <---> Heck </---> they don't even have an internally consistent style or handful of genre they stay with. They've covered puzzle rhythm adventure endless all with different atmospheres. They're basically allergic to sequels and sameness. Â The single thread connecting their games is their talent for great memorable game design. <---> So </---> when you look at SPL-TÂ [$2. 99] and I tell you it the latest amazing game from Simogo I fully expect you to look confused or laugh in my face. On the surface there seems to be nothing to this game. <---> Heck </---> technically there barely is at a 70 MB install size. <---> Pre-Atari </---> computer graphics and a few simple bleep bloop chip-tunes hide a mind bending strategic puzzle game. I'd almost call this a strategy game outright. For the record there is very likely more to this game. <---> Something </---> hidden away. This review is of the main core puzzle game that everyone is currently playing. <---> We </---> may update or post news if more is discovered. The premise is simple. <---> You </---> start with a blank screen. Every time you tap the screen a line appears. <---> The </---> line splits the cell you've tapped on vertically or horizontally in an alternating pattern. You can only split cells down to a certain length and width which becomes quickly apparent. <---> You </---> have to be mindful of the pattern because if you run out of blocks big enough to split in any direction when that type of split rolls around it game over. When a split line creates a cross consisting of four or more equally sized blocks those blocks become point blocks and are filled with the number of total splits you've currently made. <---> Now </---> as you continue making splits .
