Itâs no secret that there are some pretty expensive iOS games out there. <---> Thankfully </---> most of them tend to be free but there are still a few that are a dollar or even two (twice as much!). Even worse most of these games only use a couple of my iPadâs features. I mean if Iâm going to break the bank on a game that costs money it had better be utilizing my whole device. (Example: I bought <+++> Horizon Chase </+++>Â [Free] earlier this year for three entire dollars and quickly found that it only uses my touchscreen. <---> What </---> about the gyroscope? The microphone? <---> The </---> camera? <+++> Eeeeyoo eeeyooo! </+++> Ripoff alert!) <+++> Progress to 100 </+++> [$0. 99] is yet another of these wallet draining âpremiumâ games but I quickly found that this one is different. As I played through its hundred levels it slowly began to dawn on me: <---> This </---> game uses everything. Finally!In Ludosity ABâs <+++> Progress to 100 </+++> your goal oddly enough is to simply progress to 100. Iâm not sure if that means making it through the 100 levels or completing 100% of the game but it doesnât really matter since they are basically the same thing in this case. <---> Over </---> the course of several days I did manage to progress all the way to 100 and the experience was definitely not like anything else Iâve done on my iPad. <---> And </---> yet in another way it absolutely was like <+++> everything Iâve done on my iPad </+++>. At various points I found myself twisting it flipping it turning on Airplane mode holding it perfectly flat against a wall plugging it into a charger and pretending it was a bottle of champagne. <---> And </---> the only thing I got drunk on was puzzling. <---> Each </---> level presents you .
