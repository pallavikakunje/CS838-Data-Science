Shenandoah Studios' <+++> The Battle of the Bulge </+++> [$9. 99] is to the <---> iPad </---> what SSG fabled <+++> <html><body><a href=http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Panzer_General>Panzer General</a></body></html> </+++> was to PC gaming in the '90s. Its a game that will make historical strategy diehards swoon while also being pretty enough and easy enough to learn to draw in people who never knew that this was the game they'd been waiting for. <---> It </---> even educational with day-by-day summaries of the historical course of the Axis' last offense and additional materials about the battle presented in an incredibly appealing magazine format with historical photos. This is a game that could be taught in a military history class. <---> There </---> are several things that <+++> Battle of the Bulge </+++> is not by design. It not real time it not a multi-mission campaign it not a game where you can see every soldier fight and die in 3D animated gore thank the strategy gods. <+++> Battle of the Bulge </+++> is a wargame on what grognards call the operational scale: neither grand/strategic (representing complete control of an entire nation or at least its military on a given front) nor tactical (squad/unit level). You maneuver entire formations across a territory-level (not hex) map. <---> The </---> result is a game that looks a little like and is nearly as easy to control as <+++> Risk </+++> while being much deeper in strategy. Terrain effects including roads bridges and defensive cover are an essential part of strategy as are lines of supply. <---> Units </---> are fairly simple but sufficient: regular and elite infantry mechanized infantry and armor with artillery and airpower as environmental effects. Every unit is historical based on the actual unit its strength (represented in pips) and experience (represented for elite units with a badge containing their historical insignia). <---> Combat </---> .
