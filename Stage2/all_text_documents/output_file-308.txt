Half Brick Studios just released a simple but challenging casual game called <+++> Fruit Ninja </+++>. <---> The </---> game is a simple affair that has you swiping at the screen to dismember pieces of fruit that are lobbed in your general direction. It a bit of a shooting-gallery type experience but one you are swiping to slice rather than tapping to shoot. You're only allowed to miss 3 pieces of fruit before it game over -- but beware slicing a single bomb (thrown up randomly) will result in an instant game over. <---> In </---> fact it so simple that it hard to explain the appeal. The overall game is put together quite well and the swipe mechanism is strangely satisfying. <---> The </---> biggest feature for the game however is the quick ramp up in difficulty. It doesn't take long before you are anxiously awaiting the next volley of fruit since it takes a quick reaction time to keep playing. <---> Here </---> the developer promotional video: App Store Link: <+++> Fruit Ninja </+++> $0. 99 .
