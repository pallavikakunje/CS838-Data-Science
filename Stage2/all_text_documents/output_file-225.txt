I can't get enough of dual-stick shooter roguelikes but often the time and effort requirement is too much. I'm more of a gaming tourist â I want to enjoy a lot of different experiences in gaming rather than having to decdicate tons of hours to get the joy out of a single game. Thankfully <+++> Neon Chrome </+++> [$9. 99] from 10tons adapted for mobile from PC and console scratches that itch. It not easy by any stretch of the imagination and it can be punishing but it tones down some of the harsher parts of the roguelike-inspired genre to be more accessible up front for players who just want to enjoy a game of this type. <---> This </---> is a game where you can extract genuine rewards from it in the early hours while still getting long-term challenge and satisfaction. The concept of <+++> Neon Chrome </+++> has you trying to take down the <---> Overseer </---> that rules the massive Neon Chrome building. <---> You </---> play as a hacker who controls an asset â selected from one of three random characters with different sets of weapons and abilities â that is setting out to destroy the Overseer. You have to complete 5 chapters with several levels each and if you die you have to start at least from each chapter checkpoint. <---> This </---> isn't a true roguelike at all as credits you earn go toward upgrading your health attack luck energy and total enhancement slots. Yes you can find cybernetic enhancements as you play allowing you to get different enhancements that increase your stats or give you different abilities. <---> But </---> die and you lose them only keeping your credits and taking another shot at bringing down the Overseer. The thing I like about <+++> Neon Chrome </+++> is the way that it so .
