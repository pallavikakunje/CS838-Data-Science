But for me <+++> Pocket Planes </+++> says something. <---> It </---> avoids all of the common pitfalls of free-to-play design by executing on the simplest of concepts: providing fun without a fee. It isn't a pushy game and its systems are balanced to benefit the user. <---> In </---> this age of F2P games are starting to feel more like business models with graphics. <+++> Pocket Planes </+++> doesn't. <---> There </---> a life to everything in it. It systems and mechanics have meaning. <+++> Pocket Planes </+++> is about getting to somewhere almost anywhere in an exotic but familiar world full of mimes astronauts and headlamps. <---> Functionally </---> it a game about taking stuff to places in airplanes. As a tycoon of sorts you'll buy airports upgrade and assemble airplanes and ferry people and cargo across the globe in an endless effort to earn money in order to continue doing the above. <---> The </---> actual mechanics are rudimentary. Heavy chunks of UI tell you what people and pieces of cargo need to go where and then you click on the location to go. You can watch your airplanes fly at this point or you can wait to resume when a real-time timer ends. A neat RPG-style component keeps track of your progress. As you send out more planes and make more money you'll level up and receive the ability to purchase more airports and unlock new and roomier airplanes that can ferry more stuff in one go. <---> It </---> this carrot-on-the-stick design approach keeps the simulation engrossing. Every time you land a plane you get one step closer to buying a mega airport in say <---> France </---> or New York. <---> Every </---> time you unlock a new airplane part you feverishly check the in-game store for the rest of its constituent parts. And even when you're not looking forward .
