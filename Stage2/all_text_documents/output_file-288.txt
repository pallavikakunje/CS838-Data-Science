Kairosoftâs <+++> Pocket Academy </+++> [$3. 99 / Lite] takes the best and worst elements of its prior releases <+++> Game Dev Story </+++> [$1. 99 / Lite] and <+++> Hot Springs Story </+++> [$3. 99 / Lite] blends them together and then applies them to a school environment. Itâs not remarkable on the surface. It has the same cutesy art direction used in these prior games. <---> It </---> also re-hashes a lot of mechanics continues to shroud a lot of its crucial foundational and tycoon elements in mystery and it controls like crap. But it does still deliver in the form of the studioâs should-be patented carrot-on-the-stick design approach and fleshes out a crucial but oft-forgotten driver in all simulation games: the people. <---> Provided </---> the gun to my head wasnât real Iâd argue until the moment the trigger is pulled that <+++> Pocket Academy </+++> isnât as much of a school simulation as it is a over-the-top student simulation game because at the end of the day this game isnât about how pretty your school is or about how many trees youâve planted. Itâs about what your kids are learning and how well they can prove that your system either totalitarian or social-focused works. On the top end this game puts you in the shoes of an administrator planning out the next greatest thing in education. Youâre in charge of building classrooms researching new facilities like restrooms libraries and nursesâ offices and creating statistical bonus zones with bonus-laden objects like shrubbery trees or even rocks. <---> Chaos </---> is frowned upon as the careful planner who puts like buildings together can string together dramatic bonuses to student-side factors like learning and school spirit. This is where the one real rub rears its head: <+++> Pocket Academy </+++> isnât good at telling you .
