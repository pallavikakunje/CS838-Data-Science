Often imitated and never truly duplicated <+++> Dungeon Raid </+++> [$0. 99] is a near-perfect distillation of the <---> puzzle-RPG </---> concept and one of the better puzzle games around. To its credit even three years after its last update the game still functions properly on new hardware and updated versions of <---> iOS </---> which sadly isn't the case for all too many older games. With that said while it still perfectly playable the game is showing a lot of wear and tear from its abandonment. <---> It </---> doesn't fill out the screen on new hardware the graphics don't take advantage of retina displays and Open Feint still lingers in its icon and main menu in spite of that service having shuffled off the digital coil. <---> We </---> have to face facts my friends. Someday <+++> Dungeon Raid </+++> is not going to work anymore and we need to find a replacement. <---> In </---> a lot of ways <+++> Darkin </+++> [$0. 99] is up to the job. While other games riffing on <+++> Dungeon Raid </+++> such as 10000000 [$2. 99] and <+++> Puzzle Craft </+++> [Free] offered a lot of the same experiences they ultimately brought their own twists to the table that separated them from their inspiration somehow. <---> That </---> is of course a welcome and laudable thing to do but it also means that while they succeed in making their own paths they don't offer quite the same thing. <+++> Darkin </+++> is less ambitious in its concept instead largely choosing to throw a new coat of paint on top of the idea and buff it to a shine. It changes a few things and it does make for a slightly different experience but this is probably as close as we've gotten from any competent attempt. <---> As </---> you play the enemies get stronger .
