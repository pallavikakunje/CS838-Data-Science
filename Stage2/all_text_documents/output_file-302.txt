In a world collapsing in on itself under the weight of its machine-churned puzzle games <+++> World of Goo </+++> was a breath of fresh air when it was released in 2008. <---> It </---> was smart varied deep gorgeous and above all entertaining. The iOS version of the game will be hitting the US App Store tonight and to no-one surprise it still just as good. The truly surprising thing is that this <---> iPad </---> version is easily the definitive version of the game oft-praised puzzler. You get a real sense of connection with the game world as you dip your finger or fingers into it and the technical mastery displayed in this port is near unparalleled. <---> Everything </---> just feels perfect. It as if this was the version of the game we all should have played first. <---> At </---> first <+++> World of Goo </+++> is about manufacturing bridges and towers with the stretched tissue of little balls of goo. The point is to provide a path that other goo balls can follow into a metal pipe the end point. <---> Physics </---> play a key role in this process: you'll need to build sound structures which sounds easier than it is. Goo isn't concrete. <---> Each </---> level requires a set number of goo balls to reach the pipe and each goo ball you use for a structure counts against the total provided. This constant negotiation of goo resources is pleasing because it forces you to think around the obvious solution which is often one of brute building. <---> The </---> game doesn't rest on this basic formula. It has a bevy of twists and spins on this concept and mechanic in each level providing a stream of different looks at what is possible to do in the game. A lot of levels even introduce new goo balls .
