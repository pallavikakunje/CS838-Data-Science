Perhaps it appropriate but <+++> The Room </+++> <---> [Free </---> / $0. 99 (HD)] the original one is one of those games where it hard to take it apart piece by piece and find what exactly makes it so great. Like a real puzzle box it almost impossible not to sit there fiddling around with the box pulling at its many bits and pieces. <---> Its </---> limited scope with just a big box sitting on a table means that it isn't too hard to make progress as long as you kept trying things and if you do manage to get stuck the game has a really well-designed hint system. You keep moving forward and feeling pretty clever most of the time. <---> The </---> story sits firmly in the background for most of the game with little details you can pay attention to or ignore as you like. Whether or not you pay attention to the narrative the atmosphere is hard to resist. <---> As </---> you keep whittling down the puzzles it hard not to wonder what kind of person makes a device like this. Fireproof Studios could have kept cranking out games with that kind of narrow deep design. <---> It </---> certainly worked for <+++> Five Nights At Freddy </+++> [$2. 99]. Instead <+++> The Room Two </+++> [$1. 99] expands outward. <---> While </---> the original game could be more accurately described as <+++> The Box </+++> the sequel has you solving puzzles that spread around the entire room. You have to solve this thing over here to get the piece you need to solve that puzzle over there. <---> Rather </---> than breaking chapters between certain sections of a larger puzzle the follow-up has each chapter take place in a different room each with its own ultimate solution. Not only does this allow for more complex puzzles .
