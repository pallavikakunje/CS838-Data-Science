The mobile platform has allowed for quite a bit of experimentation. I've seen callbacks to the NES era 16-bit and more 32-bit remakes than you can shake a stick at (I'm looking at you <+++> Tomb Raider 1 </+++> and 2). But often times developers will put their own dose of charm into a game despite the fact that it doesn't belong in a single era -- and you get that feeling with <+++> Dojo Slash </+++> [Free] right from the get-go following a <---> faux-DOS </---> intro. <+++> Dojo Slash </+++> is deliciously simple. It a one-button game where tapping slashes where you tap and holding the screen will let you walk toward your finger. <---> That </---> basically it. You can constantly slash if you want to move as well and eventually as you upgrade your lunges it probably best that you do it that way anyway -- but the precision is there if you want it. <---> The </---> slash-centric gameplay facilitates plenty of ninja kills as you take on enemies of all shapes and sizes. It basically a score-attack game where you last as long as you can fighting wave after wave as they pour out across the screen. You'll have to be quick to slash as each board can often fill up with foes very quickly and there little time for idle movement. <---> This </---> also ties into the combo element of <+++> Dojo </+++> where constant kills will net you more points and thus experience. Every time you reach a certain experience goal you'll level-up which lets you choose from three random upgrades. <+++> Slash </+++> employs a pretty cool pixel art style and each locale is changed for each round to spice things up. <---> You </---> don't get to carry over any of these upgrades after death so each game will .
