So. . . what its gimmick? What exactly makes <+++> The Blockheads </+++> stand out? <---> Normally </---> the <+++> Minecraft </+++>-inspired iOS games that grab my attention are titles that take the original block-sandbox premise and spin it in some wild new direction. <+++> Block Fortress </+++> for example created a fresh intense experience by combining elements of <+++> Minecraft </+++>and the tower defense genre. <---> Another </---> of my recent favorites <+++> Junk Jack </+++> rebooted the block-sandbox aesthetic resulting in a charming game with a look and feel so distinct that I occasionally forgot about its <+++> Minecraft </+++>roots altogether. <---> Like </---> <+++> Junk Jack </+++> <+++> The Blockheads </+++> uses a 2-D side-scrolling approach to create a pleasant looking <---> iOS </---> device-friendly representation of a block-based world. But in stark contrast to its stand-out peers <+++> The Blockheads </+++> doesn't achieve greatness through sweeping gameplay innovation nor through other drastic departures in visual style. <---> Instead </---> it stands out simply by delivering a first class gameplay experience while clinging faithfully to its source material. Despite the switch to a side-scrolling perspective on a broad level <+++> The Blockheads </+++> looks and feels a whole lot like old-school <+++> Minecraft </+++>. <---> It </---> by no means a direct copy but it does nail the vibe perfectly. If this were a bad game I'd be quick to use that comparison against it but as I started sinking hours into <+++> The Blockheads </+++> it became obvious that this is no cheap clone or cash-in. The game could accurately be called an homage I suppose but even that feels like a bit of a back-handed compliment. Instead I'd sum up <+++> The Blockheads </+++> like this: a reimagining of <+++> Minecraft </+++>by a developer who knows exactly what he likes about <+++> Minecraft </+++> has a vision .
