<+++> Monsters Ate My Birthday Cake </+++> [$4. 99] is one of my favorite games of the year. It a puzzle game that bright & colorful but decidedly not just for kids. <---> It </---> a game that has complexity without frustration and takes place in a wonderful world that helps make it so much fun to just play again and again. It a puzzle game where switching between multiple characters becomes necessary to solve puzzles. <---> Each </---> level has a specific character loadout and it becomes about using their various abilities to navigate the levels. There a lot of box-pushing but different abilities for stunning enemies creating new paths and the like come into play. <---> There </---> are enemies but the game isn't necessarily about combat: there are sometimes ways to defeat them but often they must be avoided or manipulated into being useful. There a definite <---> Zelda </---> series influence here from the idea of a child hero going on a seemingly-innocuous quest to the feel of pushing blocks around to some of the music and even one direct name reference. There a number of other gaming references sprinkled throughout too but make no mistake: this is a game that stands on its own as its own unique entity. <---> It </---> plays like few other games but also has its own character and sense of whimsy to it. The game is absolutely gorgeous: it another good reason to have a <---> Retina </---> iPad. The characters aren't necessarily complicated designs but are very charming especially with the simple animations that give them just enough character. <---> The </---> soundtrack is fantastic as well and sounds great on headphones. The controls handle manipulating multiple characters about as well as is possible. <---> Itpossible </---> to switch focus on the character by tapping their icon on top of the screen or by .
