Every once in a long while things converge in this hobby in such a way that I almost feel the resulting game was aimed right at me. I'll confess I was on top of this game as soon as I saw it was <+++> The Powerpuff Girls </+++>. I can't explain why watching three super-powered kindergarteners beat the crap out of a hyper-intelligent megalomaniacal talking monkey is awesome. I shouldn't need to. Next I saw that word used to describe it: Metroidvania. <---> That </---> term gets tossed around a lot and even though most of the games that invoke it rarely deliver I'll still show up every time because I miss <+++> Metroid </+++> and <+++> Symphony </+++>-style <+++> Castlevania </+++> games. <---> Finally </---> as a ridiculously unnecessary coup-de-grace on the whole thing I saw that it was developed by none other than radiangames who have a very fine catalog of games on the <---> App Store </---> including the recent <+++> Fluid SE </+++> [$1. 99] and <+++> JoyJoy </+++> [$1. 99]. They're a developer I trust enough to buy their games as soon as they appear no questions asked. <---> With </---> so many great things coming together my natural reaction is to start waiting intently for the other shoe to drop. Luckily after playing through both modes of <+++> Powerpuff Girls: Defenders of Townsville </+++> [$3. 99] I'm still walking around with one shoe. <---> It </---> has some problems some of them expected and a few not but overall this is a really enjoyable action-adventure that uses its license well. We're given the story of the game in a cut-scene fully voiced by the show actors. The girls are fighting <---> Mojojojo </---> yet again but this time he has a new trick up his sleeve: a beam that causes the girls to forget how to .
