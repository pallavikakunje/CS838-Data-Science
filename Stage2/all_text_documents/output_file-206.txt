This little ninja was so stealthy he almost slipped right past me unnoticed. <---> When </---> <+++> Ninjin </+++> [Free] first popped up on the App Store I briefly looked at it chuckled at the title and dismissed it. Later I noticed the game was getting some love in our forums so I decided to give it a proper go and boy am I glad that I did. <---> The </---> core gameplay of <+++> Ninjin </+++> is fast-paced and fun and it packed with a lot of content for its price. I should let you guys know up front that what you get for free with <+++> Ninjin </+++> is not the full game. <---> It </---> more like a shareware version with the rest of the game unlockable via IAP for $0. 99. <---> You </---> can get an excellent feel for the game with what in the free version and rest assured you'll get your money worth should you choose to buy the full game. There are no other <---> IAPs </---> besides that one so if you are the type of player that dislikes bad IAP don't worry. <---> Anyway </---> on to the review proper. <+++> Ninjin </+++> tells the story of a clan of ninja rabbits whose carrots have been stolen by the evil Shogun Moe. <---> Your </---> mission is to retrieve the carrots at all costs and make Shogun Moe pay for messing with your clan. <---> The </---> story is told through wordless animated cutscenes that play out between levels. Not that much story is needed for this kind of game but the cutscenes are pretty cute and it nice that effort was put into making them. <---> To </---> get your carrots back you'll be running through five stages slaying enemies with your sword and your shuriken with each stage culminating in a boss battle. To hear it described .
