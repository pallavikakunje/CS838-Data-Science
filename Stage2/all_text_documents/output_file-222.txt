<+++> Does Not Commute </+++> [Free] is a game that has looked appealing and intriguing since the day I got to see it in motion. <---> Mediocre </---> posted a teaser video of it then they demoed the game to us at GDChttp://toucharcade. com/2015/03/06/gdc-2015-does-not-commute/ and it was one of my favorites there. The concept was super-fun to play with and somehow <+++> Does Not Commute </+++> got even better from there. <---> The </---> tweaked some of the things from the original GDC version and made this an absolute must-have. <---> The </---> gist of the game is that you're driving an unstoppable car from point A to point B. <---> The </---> problem is that you're then driving another car that drives in the same time frame as the first car and you must avoid crashing into that vehicle. This keeps going and going until you have a whole chaotic traffic pattern going on and you're compensating for your crazy driving to get out of your own way from ten cars ago. <---> Oh </---> and each car has its own weight speed and handling so you have to adjust to that as well. If you do crash you just go slower but you also have a time limit to deal with. <---> You </---> can rewind to when you started with a one-second time penalty. To also help out you can use one of three boosts: armor speed or traction. <---> Each </---> gives you a benefit but also comes with its own drawback. For example the speed boost makes your car have much worse traction. <---> But </---> sometimes these boosts can help you get your car there in one piece. . . or in less time. The game is about making it to the end of the game with time left and the bonus time icons that add time to your counter .
