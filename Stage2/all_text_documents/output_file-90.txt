<+++> Fates Forever </+++> [Free (HD)] is a MOBA. <---> This </---> isn't so much a description of the game genre as it is acknowledging what the game intent is. It a MOBA for iPad â and it meant to make as few concessions as possible toward providing a full-fledged MOBA experience.

Powers can be attained and upgraded with level-ups though these powers won't affect towers and bases. <---> What </---> I've done is to describe pretty much any generic MOBA that is out there and while certainly <+++> Fates Forever </+++> has its own little tweaks from countless other games these differences are just the natural differences between games in the same genre not a radical departure from any formula. <---> Now </---> this isn't a game meant to be played in short bursts. Rounds certainly feel quicker than most MOBAs: 15 minutes is a good expectation. <---> But </---> I've had matches go for almost half an hour. This is a game meant to be sat down and enjoyed on the couch not to be picked up on a whim to just .
