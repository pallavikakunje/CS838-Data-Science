iDreams' <+++> Sky Force Reloaded </+++> [Free] is a great example of how to make a fun shoot 'em up that is traditional yet fresh. The situation isn't really surprising: you fly upward through levels shooting both moving enemy formations and ground-based enemies while trying to rescue humans that are on the ground. <---> Those </---> humans are a bit disappointed if you don't pick them up but hey â sometimes dodging the plethora of enemy bullets is more important. It not exactly a ground-breaking shmup but it wins some points for variety. <---> Levels </---> occasionally throw some bullet-hell-esque hazards and vary how the boss fights work. One level even takes your weapons away and forces you to dodge hazards and collect stars the game currency. <---> There </---> a long-term progress objective here: you can upgrade your ship health weapons and powerups. You can collect ship parts for new ships with different stats with one ship unlockable if you played <+++> Sky Force 2014 </+++> [Free]. <+++> Sky Force Reloaded </+++> just winds up being very playable and good at what it trying to do without reinventing the wheel. <---> The </---> game is challenging without being excessively so. The enemies are varied and paced well throughout the levels to give you moments to breathe. <---> The </---> game has great visuals but doesn't make it too difficult to tell enemies and the environment apart. The game controls perfectly as a one-handed operation with the action slowing down when you lift your finger; this also lets you use your weapons and special powerups without requiring any crazy multi-taps or icons to use. <---> There </---> both offset touch controls and a direct ship moves where your finger is control system. Considering that <---> iDreams </---> made the first <+++> Sky Force </+++> back in 2004 for featurephones it just goes to show .
