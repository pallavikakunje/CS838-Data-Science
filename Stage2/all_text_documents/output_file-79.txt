<+++> Dragon Quest IV </+++> [$14. 99] is one of my favorite games in the entire <+++> Dragon Quest </+++> series. That also makes it one of my favorite <---> RPGs </---> and by extension one of my favorite games. Every time I run through this game I find myself impressed that a game of this vintage hasn't lost even a bit of its shine. <+++> Dragon Quest IV </+++> does many interesting things some of which are rare even today. <---> Â As </---> a result while a lot of elements of this game are going to feel familiar to RPG fans there still nothing else quite like it even with nearly 25 years of road behind it. <---> So </---> you know clearly now where I stand concerning this game but that not much use to you without telling you why I think so highly of this game. First for the people who already love <+++> Dragon Quest IV </+++> and simply want to know how the port to <---> iOS </---> worked out let me assure you that the game got a fine treatment. It based off of the DS version which itself was based on the PlayStation 1 remake using <+++> Dragon Quest VII </+++> engine. <---> It </---> uses a combination of 3D backgrounds and 2D characters and objects. The 3D backgrounds look better than they ever have having beenÂ bumped up to mobile screen resolution. <---> The </---> sprites do not enjoy such benefits and are presented as they were designed at a relatively low resolution. The sprite elements look very pixelated on retina screens with the sharper backgrounds making themÂ stand out even more. I prefer this route over a filter but your mileage will vary of course. The game plays in portrait mode and when outside of battle the whole screen is filled. <---> The </---> battles are windowed .
