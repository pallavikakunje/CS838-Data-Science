I've lost more than a few weekends to offerings from Armor Games and <+++> Soda Dungeon </+++> [Free] certainly didn't break that pattern. <---> While </---> it assuredly leans on the lighter side of the RPG scale its combination of a compelling upgrade system and quick yet not entirely brainless battles make for a pretty good way to kill a few minutes or a few hours as needed. I'm also pleasantly surprised by its generosity. <---> There </---> are no catches in the game that you can't buy your way out of with in-game currency. I'm not sure what the business plan is here but I'm not a business reviewer am I?The premise of <+++> Soda Dungeon </+++> has you playing a would-be adventurer who in spite of their motivation lacks the necessary skills to survive dungeon crawling. <---> Luckily </---> the local tavern has at least a few fools who can be duped into running in and gathering treasure for you. All it takes is a little liquid courage. <---> And </---> sugar. Lots of sugar. <---> After </---> hiring your party you'll control them as they make their way through the 100 floors of the dungeon. In the likely event they can't hack it and make a break for the nearest exit you'll get to keep the loot they drop. <---> You </---> can use gold to buy all kinds of things and use equipment to beef up your next party. Somehow you'll always get that equipment back when a party runs away so one way or another you're almost always moving forward. <---> There </---> just one problem. The local soda tavern is small and shoddy and as a result only attracts the town soda junkies. You'll need to invest in sprucing up the tavern and with every stool and table added more customers will come. <---> It </---> takes more than that .
