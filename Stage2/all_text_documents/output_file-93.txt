When a game has been revealed to be developed by one of the artists behind <+++> Monument Valley </+++> [$3. 99] it has quite a lot to live up to. <---> That </---> game is an outstanding puzzler but Iâd wager about half of its appeal is the unique wonderful visuals. It won a ton of awards and recognition--deservedly so--and I donât envy artist Jonathan Topf for developing what could be seen as a followup of sorts. <---> Sure </---> <+++> Monument Valley </+++> and his first solo outing <+++> Trick Shot </+++> [$1. 99] donât have much in common but they are both puzzle games in their own way. And of course theyâre pretty good lookin'. <---> The </---> thing youâll notice when you fire up <+++> Trick Shot </+++> for the first time is just how minimalist everything is. Youâre immediately presented with a simple box and a small area with dotted red lines all against a blank greyÂ background. When you drag your finger in the dotted area a ball appears with a line through it. <---> Let </---> go and the ball is fired hopefully into the box. The line that appears through the ball represents the angle and power of your shot and a ghost of your last attempt always remains to help dial in your next one. <---> And </---> well thatâs pretty much the whole game in a nutshell. You fire your ball into the box. <---> If </---> you fail you try again. If you succeed you move on to the next box. <---> Sure </---> there are obstacles that get progressively more difficult to deal with like wooden planks fans and teleporters. But in general youâre just bouncing your ball off of one or two things and hoping it goes into that box. <---> When </---> the mechanics are laid out on paper it may seem pretty simple .
