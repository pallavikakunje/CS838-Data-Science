Beamdog is back. <---> If </---> you aren't excited as a D&D fan you should be. <---> Not </---> just a straight port <+++> Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition </+++>[$9. 99] is bringing some new toys to the table and I've been geeking out ever since I got my hands on them. <---> Forty </---> years ago a game was published that changed my life. I wasn't alive at the time but thats besides the point. <---> In </---> case you've been away for those last 40 years let me introduce you to Dungeons & Dragons. D&D games in general are a fusion of story telling and dice determined events. These events range from social interactions to mechanical manipulations to melee combat and spell casting. <---> The </---> universe of D&D is that of swords and sorcery taverns and hamlets heroes and dice. <---> Lots </---> and lots of dice. So where does <+++> Icewind Dale </+++> fit in? <---> As </---> a follow up to the <+++> Baldur Gate </+++> duet the original IWD I and II were both met with overwhelmingly positive critical acclaim. The only reason these games weren't even more popular is that the first one hit market about the same time as the major blockbuster <---> Diablo </---> II. Boasting a robust and complicated combat system IWD: EE now today holds a high standard of logical complexity that the RPG genre as a whole can still look up to. <---> Probably </---> one of the most time worn features of the game is the graphics. Functional is probably the only positive I can come up with. If you are looking for cutting edge graphics or eye popping metal display qualities. . . what are you doing here? <---> You </---> should know that the game is gonna look dated and I dont hold that against IWD: EE. I think the most important thing to state here .
