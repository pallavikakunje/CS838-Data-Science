I was recently reading a science fiction novel that featured a central character who argued against the idea that consciousness is a good thing to have. <---> On </---> the surface that sounds absurd but think about it a little deeper. Computers absolutely demolish us when it comes to things like math and chess and some of our most creative ideas come when weâre sleeping or thinking of other things. <---> Your </---> brain stem is an incredibly quick chunk of meat and it could be argued that consciousness just slows it down. Imagine if self-awareness was required to remove your hand from a hot stove for example. Yikes. <---> It </---> may seem silly bringing such a weighty topic into the review of a cartoon-y game about cute robots but I couldnât help but think of it while playing Insomniacâs <+++> Digit & Dash </+++> [$1. 99]. Itâs a reaction game that tasks you with controlling two characters at once on either side of a vertical level and I could feel my conscious brain letting me down with every failed tap of the screen. If only I could be moreâŚ machine-like. Pure reaction with no pesky awareness getting in the way and mucking things up. I guess what Iâm trying to say is this game is hard. Itâs really really hard. But itâs hard in a good way: satisfyingly challenging with every single mistake being your fault and yours alone. <---> You </---> play as the titular Digit and <---> Dash </---> two robots in loveÂ trying to defeat the evil hot dog person who split them up. (These things happen alright?) <---> On </---> the left side of your screen is Digit and on the right is Dash. <---> They </---> run from the bottom to the top along what is essentially a straight line with various traps and enemies along it. Tapping .
