One genre that I can't get enough of is shoot 'em ups. I think I'll be taking them to my deathbed. <---> The </---> high-octane action the emphasis on pinpoint precision and the constant positive reinforcement of blowing up enemies and getting massively entertaining power-ups is just too great of a force. . <+++> Decluster </+++> [$2. 99] is my latest obsession and it ticks all the right boxes.

Enemy movements are unconventional and refreshing and out of nowhere they can start filling up the screen with a hellish amount of bullets -- and I don't use that phrase lightly. To my surprise there are also a bunch of unique bosses to fight like one that hides behind a giant series of walls similar to <+++> Arkanoid </+++> or <+++> Space Invaders </+++>. <---> Lengthy </---> intense boss fights with multiple phases are also a go and are just as thrilling as many classics in the genre. If there one thing <+++> Decluster </+++> manages to do best it link the old and the new almost effortlessly. <---> As </---> you progress you'll start to use your homing attack more actively effectively diving head-on into the amount of strategic depth this game really offers.
