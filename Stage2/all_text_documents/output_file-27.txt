It been over three years since inkle released their adaptation of the first book in the <+++> Steve Jackson Sorcery! </+++>series. <---> In </---> a lot of ways that app redefined what players expected from a mobile version of a gamebook. It would have been a far simpler matter for inkle to do the expected thing and do a straight conversion of the original books. <---> They </---> had the engine for it and the series is well-regarded enough that it probably would have done fairly well. Instead the developers decided to make something that a physical book would have a hard time approximating while at the same time appealing to the fairly large overlap between gamebook readers and tabletop gaming fans. <---> The </---> first game mostly relied on a unique presentation and reworked battle mechanics but the following two games brought more and more complexity to the table. <+++> Sorcery! 3 </+++> [$4. 99] was so near to a full-on RPG that its roots were hard to spot at times. <---> Despite </---> the established arc of this series <+++> Sorcery! 4 </+++> [$4. 99] is not more complex than the previous game in any obvious ways. Considering how much it has to wrap up and the sheer number of possibilities it has to consider I don't think it a bad thing that this ended up being a more focused experience than the last couple of games. This is a series that has allowed you to carry your character over from game to game after all and that adds up to a dizzying number of potential outcomes and solutions that inkle needed to consider. <---> To </---> its credit and unlike many other games that promise such agency <+++> Sorcery! 4 </+++> does a satisfying job of wrapping up the game according to what you've said and done .
