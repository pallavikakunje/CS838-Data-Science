I hate <+++> Bitcoin Billionaire </+++> [Free] for existing. <---> It </---> an idle clicker game where tapping the screen gets stuff that can be spent on other stuff but I've spent way too much time playing this. I've mined way too many fake bitcoins to be proud of myself in any way. I've had fun and this game provides some real excitement and does so in a way that can be played for free with innovative incentivized advertising but again I feel kind of ashamed about it. <---> Genuinely </---> it deserves five stars for excellence at what it is but perhaps one star out of spite for existing. How <+++> Bitcoin Billionaire </+++> works is that it about mining fake bitcoins by tapping the screen rapidly to mine them. <---> Then </---> those bitcoins are spent on investments which get increasingly ridiculous going from comic books to hyperloops. As well the miner tool can be upgraded to later levels which mines more bitcoins per tap. <---> And </---> this all happens while the house the miner sits in gets more ornate and ridiculous while they sit there tapping away at the keyboard watching the bitcoins come in. There fake news that runs across the top of the screen parodying games and tech and the silliness of you mining bitcoins. <---> The </---> clicker genre is fascinating to me in part because it manages to distill what a game is down to a very simple set of circumstances: the challenge is literally how much you can click in order to get more of the game currency which you then spend to make it faster. Most games are less blatant about this being their loops but clickers wear it on their sleeve. They're about satisfaction and yearning for more of it and they don't mask it in any way. <---> Heck </---> .
