<+++> Dust: An Elysian Tail </+++> [$5. 99] is the kind of game you can really lose yourself in. The sort of game that you want to take to a comfortable corner and just give all of your attention to until it finished. <---> In </---> spite of the many releases each week on iOS plenty of which are good games in their own right we don't see efforts like this terribly often on the platform. <---> At </---> least half the time we do see titles like this they're ports from another platform as <+++> Dust </+++> itself is. That a sad economic reality of the <---> iOS </---> ecosystem. The platform main appeal judging by the charts is in games that entertain in short bites perfect for the busy player or someone on the go. <---> That </---> fine sometimes but other times you really want to get into a game and players on mobile devices perhaps don't get as many opportunities to do so as we'd like. Luckily it easy to forget those gripes when you get stuck into something like <+++> Dust </+++>. <---> Initially </---> released as an Xbox 360 exclusive in 2012 <+++> Dust: An Elysian Tail </+++> is an exploratory platformer with a heavy emphasis on action. You'll travel through a variety of interconnected stages battling enemies searching out treasure and unlocking new abilities which allow you to get at previously unreachable locations. You'll meet a bunch of lively characters who will give you quests or carry the story forward in one way or another and all of them are voiced. <---> It </---> a fairly plot-heavy game and while it probably not going to win any prizes for its story it at least more engaging than the average <+++> Castlevania </+++> tale. It doesn't at all hurt that <+++> Dust </+++> is incredibly gorgeous. .
