At first glance <+++> Tower of Fortune 2 </+++> [$1. 99] looks an awful lot like the first game. <---> It </---> possesses the same faux- <+++> Game & Watch </+++> graphical style a fairly similar user interface and follows a fairly similar structure with your character attempting to reach the end of a tower by fighting his way through each floor. However the more you dig into the game the more it apparent that this is a proper sequel in every sense one could hope for. <---> It </---> builds on every aspect of the first game to such a degree that it makes the poor thing feel positively obsolete and all without compromising the core that made it so enjoyable in the first place. Of course the main mechanic of the game revolves around slots. <---> On </---> each floor you need to explore ten times before facing the boss. To explore you simply play the slots. <---> Depending </---> on what comes up you'll either find some meat or ore camp for the night take some unavoidable damage or fight. The first two additionally have a random chance of an NPC encounter. There are quite a few different NPC encounters and they'll have you doing everything from giving directions to arm-wrestling an orc. Depending on what you do these can also lead into a fight. <---> No </---> matter what comes up on the fifth and tenth turn you'll face a mini-boss and a boss respectively. Battles are also played using the slot machine this time with the outcomes being a physical attack that damages the enemy an enemy attack that damages you a magic attack that stuns them and a charge-up move that eventually culminates in you turning into a powered up rage-beast. <---> Getting </---> the same type of move on the next turn sets up a combo .
