The first half of 2014 was pretty packed with roguelikes with games like <+++> Wayward Souls </+++> [$6. 99] <+++> Cardinal Quest 2 </+++> [Free] and <+++> Hoplite </+++> [$2. 99] all taking their respective stab at the venerable sub-genre. <---> This </---> year has been a little more quiet on that front with only a few offerings of any note at all. The best of this year bunch until now has been <+++> Lamp And Vamp </+++> [$1. 99] which while very fun was riffing pretty closely on <+++> Hoplite </+++>. <---> Well </---> mark it on your calendars friends because I think we've got our first fresh hit of 2015 in the genre with <+++> Auro </+++> [$1. 99] the latest game from the developers behind <+++> 100 Rogues </+++> [$2. 99]. <---> This </---> one been cooking at Dinofarm Games for quite a long time now but I think it certainly worth the wait. It tempting to compare <+++> Auro </+++> to <+++> Hoplite </+++> and I'm certainly going to be drawing lines between certain mechanics in this review but in truth it a very different game. <---> Yes </---> it a turn-based game that plays out on hex-based stages but the overall goal is quite different. Instead of simply trying to make your way to each exit as safely as possible you need to go on the offensive in <+++> Auro </+++>. <---> Each </---> round has you working towards a particular overall score with points awarded for defeating the enemies that litter each stage. Stronger enemies cough up more points but you'll have to work hard to earn them. <---> Racking </---> up kill combos will yield even more points encouraging you to engage the enemy rather than play a stick and move game. There are incentives for making your way to the exit of each stage .
