I was about five years old when film <+++> The Rocketeer </+++> hit theatres so I donât remember a whole lot about the characters or plot. What I do remember is strapping a pair of 2-liter bottles to my back and zooming around my backyard like a lunatic. Iâm almost afraid to re-watch the movie now that Iâm older because I have nothing but good feelings about it currentlyÂ and I donât want cold hard reality to tarnish them. <---> That </---> childhood wonder I felt while pretending to fly around in an awesome dieselpunk jetpack was pretty priceless ya know? <+++> Piloteer </+++> [$2. 99] the latest P-titled game from <---> Fixpoint Productions </---> seeks to recapture that feeling and shrink it down into a mobile-friendly package. And Iâm happy to report it pulls it off. Itâs absurdly challenging but incredibly fun once you get the hang of it. <---> Except </---> there a good chance you wonât ever fully âget the hang of itâ but donât worry--thatâs actually part of the fun. You play as the titular <---> Piloteer </---> a woman who apparently has a deathwish since none of your flights are likely to last very long (at least in the beginning). You tap either side of the screen to activate the corresponding jets which push you up and over in whatever direction you want to go. <---> Pretty </---> simple right? Youâd think! To say itâs âtrickyâ would be a pretty massive understatement but thatâs ultimately what makes the game so satisfying. <---> Being </---> successful at maneuvering the jetpack has nothing to do with having the right upgrades or the quickest reflexes itâs about mastering a skill. Itâs the same reason I love games like <+++> True Skate </+++> [$1. 99]; you need to practice and once you start getting better everything clicks and itâs like a whole new .
