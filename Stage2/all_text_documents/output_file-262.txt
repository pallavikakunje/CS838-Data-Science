One minute spent with <+++> God of Blades </+++> [Free] and it clear that it isn't the most mechanically complex or the tightest side-scrolling hack-and-slash out there. <---> Its </---> biggest problem is its scenario design which is ignorant of how floaty the core combat feels. Boss fights in particular are too technical and desire a level of mastery impossible to summon given how your guy kinda glides and bounces through the battlefield. <---> But </---> what <+++> God of Blades </+++> lacks in functional mechanical sizzle it makes up for threefold with amazing art and sound direction. The tortured veiny world the art conjures and the surreal music it uses to bolster its paranoid sci-fi vibe are both riveting aspects that suck you into a surreal universe and refuse to let go. <---> In </---> short <+++> God of Blades </+++> is one of those style over substance games in which the creative elements manage to trump everything else. Its ability to consistently deliver the exotic and bizarre pays off; its curiosities are the engaging thing here the mechanics are an oddly secondary kind of thing. <---> And </---> it all begins with a shot of the cosmos. Strange synthesized sounds burp out of the speaker as you're alerted to the fact that a <---> Black Wind </---> has returned. Worlds are being thrust into void the <---> Great Doom </---> is upon the universe. You a carrion king who was once a great <---> Hero </---> are tasked with annihilating this evil. Boiling down the action <+++> God of Blades </+++> is a 2D fighter with an auto-run mechanic. The auto running is nice because it leaves you to focus on the micro-managing of the upswings the downswings the spinning slashes and the parries that compose the swipe-based swordplay component. <---> Presumably </---> the combat was intended to deliver on a rock paper scissors .
