I'm going to take a guess dear reader and say that you have played an endless runner or two hundred. I don't think you've played anything on mobile quite like <+++> Fotonica </+++> [$2. 99]. <---> It </---> an auto-runner by way of <+++> Mirror Edge </+++> [$0. 99 / $9. 99 (HD)] â not the side-scrolling game but the original game in first-person all in a wireframe style. The entire game is played with one touch but it not tap-to-jump. <---> Essentially </---> tapping and holding on the screen descends to the ground and allows the runner to pick up speed while letting go jumps in the air. When jumping trying to land with this rapid descent is important to maintain speed as bonus points are earned for running fast enough that the world turns gold. I think the game is a much different and even better experience than it would be if it was just a side-scroller. There something different about timing jumps when looking through the eyes of the runner having to be cognizant of when the ledge is and just making that jump? <---> It </---> a special feeling. The subtle grunts of the runner go a long way too: it not just a distant disconnected character it a person it you. I think it turns this game from an interesting runner into a special experience. Really the whole game is about just enough. <---> The </---> world is comprised of wireframes but with just enough detail to provide some character. The game uses just enough color beyond its monochrome to give it vibrancy and not feel dull. <---> The </---> music is ambient meant to provide texture to the world and not be distracting. Arcade mode is comprised of seven set levels with paths that go higher and lower throughout them. <---> The </---> goal is not .
