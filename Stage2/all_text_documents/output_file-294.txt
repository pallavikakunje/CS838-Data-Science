Last week a little gem of a game was released into the <---> App Store </---> called <+++> Tactical Soldier - Undead Rising </+++> [$4. 99]. Now I know what you must be thinking and yes the whole zombie thing has totally been done to death (undeath?). <---> But </---> the highly tactical turn-based gameplay in <+++> Tactical Soldier </+++> will have you forgetting all about that and the zombie theme is actually used to great effect in telling an interesting story and creating tension in the game. You play as a soldier in a military base where an experiment has gone awfully wrong. <---> Scientists </---> have developed a chemical in an effort to create super soldiers but instead it ends up turning them into bloodthirsty zombies. Yeah itâs a bit clichĂŠ but it fits the game well. <---> The </---> graphics are entirely rendered in 3D and although the character models arenât the most detailed the environments have a wonderfully creepy mood to them. <---> The </---> story unfolds with comic book-style cutscenes which do a good job of telling the gritty tale.

Gameplay is grid-based and a smart use of single and double tapping allows you to have great control with all of your movements. <---> The </---> touch detection can be a little finicky at times but overall the game is incredibly intuitive and feels built from the ground up with touch screens in mind. The single player story-driven campaign in <+++> Tactical Soldier </+++> requires a great deal of strategy to be successful. <---> Careful </---> conservation of ammo and deciding what weapons to equip your .
