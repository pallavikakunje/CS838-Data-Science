About a year ago I had a sad realization that mobile MMO isn't really a living genre. <---> For </---> better or worse mobile game development is most effective when creating innovative and elegant gameplay on a flat straight forward canvas. Unfortunately not much of that is what you expect to see in an mmo. <---> It </---> should come as no surprise that one of the first jolts of life being thrust into the rotting carcass of the genre is about as close to a straight PC port as you could get. <+++> Dofus Touch </+++> [Free] is out now for <---> iPhone </---> and iPad and outside of some of the most recent updates this game is a carbon copy of the PC version. Depending on you general disposition that last sentence could have been the lamest or coolest one you've read in a long time. <---> Mmos </---> are very polarizing in nature and <+++> Dofus </+++> is no exception so let get some things out of the way. I am going to earnestly ask some questions and if you answer yes to any of them you may experience annoyance or frustration playing Dofus. <---> Do </---> you enjoy quest driven gameplay? Do you enjoy non-repetitive gameplay? <---> Do </---> leveling grinds make you uneasy? Do you find animated sexualization out of place in 2016? (Yeah I have to say yes to this one more on this later. )Created by <---> French </---> developer Ankama <+++> Dofus </+++> is a game that has more in common with eastern grind <---> MMOs </---> than western games that focus on quests and an easily reached end game/max level. The gameplay is very similar to <+++> Final Fantasy Tactics Advanced </+++> where you have special rules in each combat on top of normal play that grant a bonus to loot and xp if followed. <---> Each </---> individual .
