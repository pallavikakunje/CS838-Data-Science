<+++> Angry Birds </+++> is a game that doesn't even pretend to have a story and I really appreciate that. <---> The </---> full intro to the game is a single picture which illustrates some green pigs stealing eggs from a variety of birds. Naturally the only way for the birds to vindicate this atrocity is to launch themselves from a slingshot in a suicidal attempt to take the lives of as many pigs as possible. I like to think that because the pigs are green this is some sort of swine-flu revenge fantasy but it likely that there zero credence to that idea. With all of that out of the way players are haphazardly tossed into aÂ level in which several angry-looking red birds are gathered around a primitive slingshot with a small wooden tower harboring a little green pig to the right. <---> Touching </---> and dragging backwards on the bird that is currently mounted in the slingshot will prime your disturbed little critter for launch. From here your goal is to aim your shot effectively and take out a weak point on the pig tower causing him to fall to his little piggy doom. <+++> Angry Birds </+++> will hand you preset numbers and types of birds in each level so strategy becomes key as you find yourself trying to figure out how each of your birds can work cooperatively to cause some <---> Rube </---> Goldberg-worthy destruction. Over the course of the 63 levels in the game the challenges will become more difficult yet simultaneously more rewarding upon completion. <---> There </---> isn't much in the way of extras in <+++> Angry Birds </+++>. While developers <---> Rovio </---> have promised Leaderboard support in a future update for now the only thing to do in the game is play those 63 levels. <---> There </---> is no tutorial no .
