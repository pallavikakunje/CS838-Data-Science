Itâs weird how much gaming has changed since I was a kid. <---> In </---> the old days sequels usually meant a game would be bigger and better in nearly every way with more levels characters new modes etc. Consider <+++> Perfect Dark </+++> the spiritual sequel to <+++> Goldeneye 007 </+++> for example. <---> It </---> was absolutely bursting with new stuff to do. There was the campaign and multiplayer (like <+++> Goldeneye </+++>) but it also had a brand new challenge mode a gun range a co-op and counter-op campaign mode a main menu that you could walk around in and a massive customizable bot mode that I lost a large chunk of my adolescence to. These days though things are a bit different. <---> Because </---> games tend to have more content added through updates and DLC that means version 1. 0 of a sequel can often feelÂ a bit lacking. Itâs especially striking when you consider <---> iOS </---> classic <+++> Badland </+++> [$2. 99] which is certainly one of the most updated games I can think of. Itâs the reverse of my <+++> Perfect Dark </+++> example where the original game is the one now bursting with levels and modes while the sequel feels a bit sparse in comparison. Itâs an interesting problem to have but even despite that I think <+++> Badland 2 </+++> [$3. 99] is a superior game to the original with the potential to surpass it many times over in terms of quality and amount of content. Of course we canât review a game based on what it could potentially be. <---> Nearly </---> every game on the App Store seems to have more levels and whatnot âCOMING SOON!â and half the time the promise is left unfulfilled. Still I think <---> Frogmind </---> has earned our trust in the case of <+++> Badland 2 .
