Yeah you read that right. <+++> ReRunners: Race for the World </+++> [Free] is a massive multiplayer online platformer. <---> Kind </---> of. You never actually see other live players but the world is populated and alive regardless. <---> And </---> it is freaking outstanding. I have been utterly hooked by this game for the last week. <---> Not </---> only is the actual gameplay smooth fun and functional but the crazy vibrant psychedelic world that youâll explore is almost worth the price of admission alone. Or it would be if this game even had a price tag. <---> There </---> is a ton of expressive creative content with loads of customization options for your character and upgrades. I implore you to read on my friends for this is one of the most original games Iâve had the good fortune to be completely addicted to this year. <---> ReRunners </---> was developed by Klang Games and published by <---> Tilting Point </---> and Games Alliance. <---> In </---> it youâll compete in platforming races against the recorded ghosts of other players. Because of this random element to the matchmaking every race is unique but doesnât suffer from lag and allows you to pause or use unique abilities that slow down time and such. <---> Players </---> can bring different items into the run with them like mines and speed boosts and thrown bombs and they can also pick up coins before you. I originally thought that while the races used ghost recordings the over-world surely must have been populated by real players. <---> It </---> feels so alive and at times it will seem like youâre directly interacting with people. Nope. Apparently theyâre all ghost recordings according to what Iâve read. <---> At </---> the very least this means you donât have to worry about the world being empty and barren in the future which is exactly why I was .
