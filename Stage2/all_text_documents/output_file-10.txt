I like playing games that may exist in a particular genre but are willing to defy the conventions of that genre to create something different. <---> That </---> exactly what 10tons has done with <+++> Xenoraid </+++> [Free] their entry into the shoot 'em up genre. It does things differently from other games and maybe you won't like it! <---> Western </---> shmups are already so different from Eastern ones due to cultural differences. <+++> Xenoraid </+++> manages to even transcend that difference and feels like its own unique shoot 'em up. <---> But </---> you might just enjoy what this heterodox title has to bring to the table. The heart of <+++> Xenoraid </+++> is in its 4-ship system where you roll into battle with well 4 different ships. <---> These </---> ships come in several different types and you can switch between them at will though with a bit of a delay as to when you can switch to a new one. It kind of like <+++> Marvel vs. Capcom </+++> but as a shoot 'em up. <---> You </---> can even use the ship-swapping as a way to avoid hazards. Not only do you get a temporary invincibility from the process of the swap but you also can switch from a slow behemoth to a speedy ship that can dodge hazards much better. <---> This </---> ship-swapping really gives <+++> Xenoraid </+++> a unique feel. Sometimes in a shoot 'em up with ship customization options I can feel kind of trapped by having just one ship option. Here while I kind of prefer the behemoths as they can take more damage and deal more out I like having the option to switch between ships as I feel like it and it keeps things feeling fresh. Losing a ship also means that you have to adjust your strategy on the .
