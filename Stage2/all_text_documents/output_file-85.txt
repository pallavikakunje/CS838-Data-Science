Shortly before <---> iOS </---> took over my life one of my favorite games was <+++> Boom Blox </+++> on the Wii. It was the brainchild of a little known game designer by the name of <---> Steven Spielberg </---> (who also dabbles in film Iâm told) and it was absurdly fun. Thereâs something about huge explosions and large structures toppling over that delights the eight year old boy in me and <+++> Boom Blox </+++> (and especially itâs sequel <+++> Bash Party </+++>) took over my free time for countless weeks. Ever since those days Iâve been yearning for something like that on mobile and while there have been a couple physics-based games that provide a similar feeling (my favorite being <+++> Turbo Dismount </+++> [Free]) none have quite captured the floaty block-on-block destruction Iâve craved since 2009. <+++> [Dramatic pause. ] </+++>Â . . . <---> That </---> is until now. Monkeyrama [Free] by <---> Tuomas Erikoinen </---> feels really really close to <+++> Boom Blox </+++>. The physics are absolutely dead-on and because of that itâs an utterÂ joy to play. <---> Each </---> level presents you with a structure (or two or three) made of different types of blocks (wood stone ice etc. ) and your job is simply to destroy it. To do that you need to throw monkeys at it. <---> Yes </---> monkeys. (Well their heads anyway. ) <---> Like </---> the blocks there are different flavors of monkeys including explosive monkeys heavy monkeys and--my favorite--sticky monkeys. To pass a level you just need to hit a certain score threshold which is achieved by having as many blocks as possible fall off the foundation. Itâs incredibly easy to grasp once you dive in and part of what makes it work so well is how intuitive everything is. <---> Controlling </---> the game is as simple as swiping and tapping.
