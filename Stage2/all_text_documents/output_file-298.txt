If you asked me a couple of months ago to make a list of game types that were highly unlikely to ever be realized in a satisfying way on a touchscreen I can guarantee that stylish action games would be on the short list. The sub-genre launched when wunderkind director <---> Hideki Kamiya </---> sat down to make another <+++> Resident Evil </+++> game decided that it would be more fun if every attack felt as good as doing a headshot with a shotgun and ended up creating <+++> Devil May Cry </+++>. One game does not a sub-genre make but once <---> Tomonobu Itagaki </---> created his masterpiece re-imagining of <+++> Ninja Gaiden </+++> we were off to the races. It not the most prolific genre probably because it so hard to do right but it seen its share of hits including the mainstream-friendly <+++> God of War </+++> series the campy and cool <+++> Bayonetta </+++> and the amazing parry-focused <+++> Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance </+++>. <---> These </---> games are usually characterized by their highly-technical deep combat where players are graded according to how well they can dance to the game beat. This usually involves a lot of different buttons and we all know how well that usually works out on a touchscreen. <---> You </---> take the role of a warrior named Black who is fighting zombies and other supernatural creatures that have attacked a village for extremely unclear reasons. <---> This </---> game has a really bizarre localization making it very difficult to follow the plot. I'm not even sure whose dark soul I should be filling with light. <---> Well </---> it not like this genre has ever gotten by on storytelling <+++> God Of War </+++> aside. The important thing is that <---> Black </---> has a sword and likes to kill monsters with it. He has .
