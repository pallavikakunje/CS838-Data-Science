The biggest standout in <+++> Bumpy Road </+++> is its innovative control mechanic. A car carrying a cute married couple drives automatically to the right but you donât actually control the car itself. Instead touching anywhere on the screen raises the elevation of the ground and creates a bump in the road. <---> Using </---> this you can create a sort of wave to push the car back and forth or quickly tap under it to pop it into the air. This mechanic is dead simple to understand but definitely takes some practice for it to click. <---> Once </---> it does however youâll be bouncing the little car all over the screen like an old pro and it truly feels great. At its core <+++> Bumpy Road </+++> is a high scoring game that contains two different modes to play. <---> The </---> first Evergreen Ride is an endless trek along a randomly generated set of track designs. <---> You </---> try to make it as far as possible without running out of fuel or falling into a watery pit. Along you path various types of gizmos are lying around waiting to be collected. <---> Grabbing </---> these will continuously fill your fuel gauge and if you fill the gauge completely youâll trigger a bonus sequence that speeds up your car and removes any pits allowing you to concentrate on picking up as many gizmos as you can before the sequence ends. The second mode is <---> Sunday Trip </---> and gives you another randomly generated level to drive in but one that has a finish line. The goal is to get to the finish line as quickly as possible. <---> There </---> arenât any water pits to worry about here and collecting boost or clock items will improve your time at the end. There are gizmos to collect in this mode too .
