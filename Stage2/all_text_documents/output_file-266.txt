It been a few years since <+++> Super Stickman Golf 2 </+++> [Free] first released and there been plenty of time for that game to kind of fade into memories to a certain degree what with the constant deluge of releases that mobile gamers are beset by. <---> So </---> even huge fans of that game might have forgotten just why it was so much fun. And really that what <+++> Super Stickman Golf 3 </+++> [Free] does best: it advances the franchise with its new spin mechanic but also shows just how solid the core established by earlier games was. <---> It </---> just better than ever. If you haven't played a game in the <+++> Stickman Golf </+++> [$2. 99 / $2. 99 (HD)] franchise well this is as good a time as any particularly with the game being free-to-play but far from annoying about it. <---> This </---> is 2D physics-based golf as always where you set your shot angle your power and traverse courses both vertical and horizontally-arranged in order to try and get in the hole in as few strokes as possible. <---> It </---> is a golf game after all. But you get all sorts of powerups that you can earn and deploy to help get around the very difficult courses. <---> There </---> are new courses with new tricks but the core game itself is largely unchanged. It a formula that leads to plenty of wacky happenings can test you immensely but lead to amazing rewards when you hit that perfect shot. <---> Oh </---> and if you land cleanly in the hole you lose a stroke. Prepare to go mad high score chasers and turn-based players who lose by one stroke due to a perfect swish. <---> Noodlecake </---> did not mess with the core of what works. The spin mechanic is what is new in .
