For the first half of my 20 hours and change with <+++> 7 Mages </+++> [Free] I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. For whatever reason the game wasn't on my radar at all and when it released seemingly out of nowhere with gorgeous screenshots and some lofty comparisons being thrown around I was skeptical. Well the game has its flaws but nothing like what I was fearing. <+++> 7 Mages </+++> is a great addition to the iOS RPG library and one that fills a particular niche few other games on the platform do. <---> Its </---> apparent inspirations are numerous but it safe to say that if you've got any love for computer RPGs from the late 1980s and early 1990s you should definitely give <+++> 7 Mages </+++> a try. <---> The </---> story of the game is another take-off of Akira Kurosawa benchmark film <+++> Seven Samurai </+++>. <---> Replace </---> the little rice-farming town with an island where magic materials can be harvested the bandits with prospectors and the samurai with mages and you've basically got the gist of it. It a decent enough framework for an RPG though <+++> 7 Mages </+++> doesn't do as much with its story as I would have liked. You'll get interesting conversations here and there but the focus rests squarely on the gameplay. <---> For </---> the most part <+++> 7 Mages </+++> resembles a first-person dungeon-crawl RPG along the lines of things like <+++> The Quest </+++> [$4. 99] and <+++> Legend Of Grimrock </+++> [$4. 99]. <---> Its </---> combat is turn-based and it allows you to split up your party members and control them individually. It sort of like playing a turn-based strategy game from a first-person view. <---> The </---> puzzles in the game are more reminiscent of an adventure game often requiring you .
