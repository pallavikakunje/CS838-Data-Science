I've often felt that the genre that perhaps benefited the most from the jump from 2D to 3D was racing. Really thinking about it racing is one of the genres that begged the most for polygons having already spent years working in <---> pseudo-3D </---> with scaling sprites and optical tricks. Hardware that couldn't manage said tricks tended to have racers that skewed the perspective to at least offer some sort of visual depth. <---> Racers </---> that opted for a strict flat side-view to the action were historically pretty rare outside of obstacle course time-attacks like <+++> Motocross Maniacs </+++>. There are lots of reasons as to why that was likely the case but it mostly comes down to the simple idea that it hard to express the excitement of racing from that point of view. <---> If </---> there is no depth there no passing no hairpin turns no drafting and collisions become hard to sort out. You have to find other ways to bring the beautiful tension that makes racing so compelling and that just what <+++> Pixel Boat Rush </+++> [Free] sets out to do. <+++> Pixel Boat Rush </+++> is a boat-racing game with an 8-bit visual style that uses a side-view of the action with the waves looking more like rolling hills than water. <---> The </---> basic structure of the game has you clearing small tutorial-like missions to earn a license which then gives you access to a particular league and the group of boats that go with it. The amount of events varies between leagues but in total there are more than 50 events set across the game 16 tracks. They'll often have special rules or stipulations so you're constantly having to learn new tricks to advance keeping the game fresh all the way through. <---> You </---> can also run time .
