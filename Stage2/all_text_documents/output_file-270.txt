From a presentation standpoint <+++> Reckless Racing 2 </+++> makes some significant changes in comparison to its predecessor. <---> Gone </---> are the country themes present in the music and characters (although the latter still remains somewhat in the avatars and names of your AI opponents). <---> In </---> its place is a stylized clean motif complete with fast-paced music reminiscent of 80s action movies (think <+++> Top Gun </+++>). Some folks may argue <+++> Reckless Racing 2 </+++> loses some of the âcharmâ found in the original but I think this is a great move that moves towards a more universal appeal. Another area that receives an overhaul in <+++> Reckless Racing 2 </+++> is its core gameplay formula. A comprehensive career mode takes center stage in this sequel complete with 18 different cars to purchase and a plethora of upgrades available for each individual vehicle. The career mode is actually pretty standard - players race through a variety of cups containing several courses. <---> Money </---> is awarded after each race with a larger monetary bonus depending on your final position at the end of the cup. Rather than forcing players to complete cups in a sequential fashion <+++> Reckless Racing 2 </+++> employs a <---> Performance Index </---> (P. I. ) restriction. The higher a P. I. rating is on a car the âbetterâ it is stats-wise. <---> Modify </---> your car with new parts and its P. I. rating increases. Cups have a P. I. range that your car must fit into in order to play. <---> While </---> it is possible to upgrade your car so it can participate in progressively harder cups eventually its P. I. max will be reached and youâll have to buy a new car with a higher range in order to advance to more difficulty cups. Itâs a disappointing restriction for folks .
