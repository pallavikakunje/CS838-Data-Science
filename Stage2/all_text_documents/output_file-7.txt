A few weeks ago <---> TouchFoo </---> teased us with a gravity defying trailer promising a fun innovative and action-packed platformer game for the iPhone. They have since fully delivered on that promise with the release of <+++> Soosiz </+++> <---> [App </---> Store]. The basic gameplay found in <+++> Soosiz </+++> is that of a traditional platformer where you run and jump your way past obstacles and enemies while collecting coins and rescuing your buddies along the way. <---> Some </---> enemies can be dispatched by simply jumping on their heads while others need to be avoided completely. As is typical in platformers timing and dodging become important skills in later levels. <---> Rescuing </---> buddies can give you additional powers (jumping higher running faster) and once you have 100 coins you can trigger a brief indestructible power-up allowing you to easily plow through enemies. <+++> Soosiz </+++> is very easily controlled with simple left/right virtual buttons and a jump button. Holding the jump button longer makes you jump higher. <---> The </---> big twist to the game is its gravity-changing mechanic. When jumping to a platform above you the entire world spins around and up becomes down. <---> While </---> this all seems like it might just be a novel gimmick Touch Foo manages to utilize it fully across <+++> Soosiz </+++> 7 worlds and 65 levels. <---> The </---> gravity experience is truly an integral part of the game and not simply a tacked on afterthought. Triggering this gravity manipulation simply requires you to jump onto another platform and becomes second nature very quickly. <---> The </---> game was in development for 6 months and it really shows in <+++> Soosiz </+++> excellent level designs. <+++> Soosiz </+++> manages to constantly introduce new elements and obstacles to keep the game fresh and interesting across its 7 worlds. Each world carries its own themes .
