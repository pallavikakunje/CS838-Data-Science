There a certain attraction to time travel stories. <---> Sometimes </---> they're about comparing the present to the past particularly by sticking a fish out of their water. Other times they're used as a way to think about the future and the promise it holds. <---> Most </---> of them really come down to a simple question: what would the present be like if things had gone differently in the past? Ultimately time travel stories are more often than not morality tales about appreciating what we have and who we are. A warning about greed and how it can leave you with less than you had. A means of dealing with regret and the paralysis it can bring. <---> Well </---> except for <+++> Back to the Future </+++>. That one about making out with a younger version of your hot mom and getting a new truck. <---> The </---> first half of Steins;Gate [$8. 99 / $8. 99 (HD)] is kind of like <+++> Back to the Future </+++>. <---> It </---> about how time travel could be used to fulfill wishes and clean up regrets. It dives happily into the science both real and theoretical behind its time travel mechanics and spends a long time acquainting you with its cast of characters. <---> The </---> characters aren't really mature enough to understand the consequences of their actions. It hard to blame them for that though. They're young and idealistic and it all seems to be going pretty well for everyone until everything comes unglued. <---> It </---> hard to pull off an entertaining story about a bunch of kids getting whatever they want in between lengthy spews of technobabble though so things inevitably start to go awry. Oh my do they go awry. <+++> Steins;Gate </+++> is a visual novel and like most games in that genre you'll be spending most of .
