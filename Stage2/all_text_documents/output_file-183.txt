<+++> Tetris </+++> [$1. 99] is one awesome game. I personally consider it one of the best games ever made and certainly one of the closest to pure perfection. <---> While </---> most other games are work-in-progress designs that eventually have to be snipped off polished up and released <+++> Tetris </+++> big coming-out releases on Game Boy and NES were essentially flawless realizations of the design potential. Other than catching up with technology like internet play what do you really add to <+++> Tetris </+++> to make it better? <---> Every </---> attempt to change the game in some way has resulted in at best a lateral move and at worst an absolute disaster. Well <+++> 99 Bricks: Wizard Academy </+++> [Free] offers a few interesting answers to my question and while it probably not a better game it a more than worthy side-trip for fans of that classic. <---> The </---> goal of 99 Bricks is to build yourself a wizard tower out of falling bricks all of which are in the shapes of the familiar <+++> Tetris </+++> blocks. <---> You </---> need to get your tower as high as you can to show what a cool wizard you are. Each of the game stages starts you off with a different shape for the base and it up to you to build it up from there. <---> Along </---> the way rival wizards who are jealous of your tower will pop in to throw some complications in but generally your worst enemies are going to be gravity and your own mistakes. If you you lose too many blocks off the sides of your tower the game will spawn a tower top finishing off your current run. <---> The </---> camera will zoom out to let you have a look at your completed tower and you'll be given some coins .
