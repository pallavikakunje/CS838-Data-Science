Typically I'm not a big fan of the sim-management type games. <---> Back </---> in the day I was hopelessly addicted to <+++> SimCity </+++> on the SNES but future iterations of that game and of similar franchises just never appealed to me. They all seemed a bit too complicated or required a hectic style of time and resource managing that turned me off to them and nothing has quite captured the particular mix of simplicity and subtle depth from that classic SNES title. That changed yesterday when I discovered Kairosoft <+++> Game Dev Story </+++> [$3. 99] on my iPhone. <---> It </---> offers a sim-management experience that not overwhelmingly complex but at the same time has a lot of different elements that meld together well to create compelling gameplay. Plus it just a ton of fun to create your own games and see them go on to be huge successes (and sometimes total flops). <---> In </---> <+++> Game Dev Story </+++> you'll play the president of a fledgling game development company as you direct your crew of designers artists and coders in an effort to create a string of successful video games over a 20 year time period. Beyond just making games you'll need to grow your own brand name by running a game convention booth attending awards shows advertising and managing an ever-changing fan base. <---> As </---> your company expands you'll have the opportunity to move into larger offices and hire a bigger team of employees all of whom can be leveled up and trained (at the expense of Â higher salaries) so as to create better games. If you really become a big company and have employees with the right skill sets you can even create your own console and compete with the well established big boys in the hardware game. <---> To </---> start .
