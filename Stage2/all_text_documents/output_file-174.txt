<+++> Pokemon </+++> clones are by no means a new thing. With as much success as <---> Nintendo </---> monster-catching RPG has enjoyed clones are simply an expected part of doing business. They're not even a new thing for iOS. I've reviewed both <+++> Hunter Island </+++> [$0. 99] and <+++> Band of Monsters </+++> [Free] in the last year to say nothing of the many <+++> Puzzle & Dragons </+++> [Free]-inspired games released that borrow liberally from <+++> Pokemon </+++>. <---> That </---> said with all of the clones homages parodies and more that I've played over the years none have skated quite so closely to <+++> Pokemon </+++> game design as <+++> Micromon </+++> [$0. 99]. There little pretense about what they're doing here with cheeky references all over the place and gameplay that is certainly the spitting image of <+++> Pokemon </+++> imagined as a $0. 99 mobile game. <---> Well </---> originality isn't everything. As the game starts you get sucked into a digital world <+++> Captain N </+++>-style through your mobile device. <---> In </---> this world people collect train and battle with monsters called Micromon. After a brief prologue your goals are made clear. <---> You </---> have to collect as many Micromon as you can defeat the four town heroes and maybe take on some bad guys along the way. You're basically on a road trip from town to town with the routes between each town filled with <---> Micromon </---> lurking in the tall grass. Sometimes you'll go into a cave or something. <---> It </---> <+++> Pokemon </+++> guys and gals. Get out there catch some monsters train up your favorites and take on all comers. <---> Then </---> when your team is where you want it go play against some human opponents to really test your skills. There a story here but like the one found .
