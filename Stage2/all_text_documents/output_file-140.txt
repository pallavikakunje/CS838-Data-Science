I can't recall if it been formally announced but this twelfth installment in <---> Tin Man </---> long-running <+++> Gamebook Adventures </+++> series is at least for now the last. The series has had ups and downs but even the weaker installments helped flesh out the fascinating fantasy world of <---> Orlandes </---> so I'm a little sad to see it going on hiatus. I am however ecstatic that it doing so with <+++> Asuria Awakens </+++> [$1. 99] which is not only the best <+++> Gamebook Adventures </+++> yet but also one of the finer traditional-style gamebooks I've ever played. <---> The </---> creative team behind this game seemingly held nothing back giving us a quest that takes your character from a lowly gofer to a savior. There are a lot of gamebooks that do that mind you but you really have to earn it in this one and it feels great. <---> The </---> story starts off with your character being summoned in a rather unusual way by the Duke. In recounting your past adventures to him you determine your character special skills and abilities. <---> Once </---> that done he sends you on a mission to visit the city of Casporur and search for his missing emissary. <---> Upon </---> arriving at the city you'll probably notice that something strange is in the air. Tremors are shaking the city and people are whispering about the return of the legendary god Asuria. I don't want to spoil any of the story but the game is essentially broken into four parts with smaller bits in between. Each part could probably stand on its own as an individual adventure but every time you think you might be coming to the end something else happens. <---> When </---> the ending finally does come it doesn't let you down. One of the problems I've seen crop .
