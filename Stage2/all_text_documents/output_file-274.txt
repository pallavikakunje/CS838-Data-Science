The idea is to make a sandwich by collecting ingredients from around the platform level. <---> You </---> can start with a basic cheese sandwich but you can add non-standard fillings like burgers apples oranges or hot-dogs. And then what the heck let throw <---> in:Â Wine </---> bottles flowers tins potted plants beach-balls and much much more. Each time you add another filling your sandwich gets taller until you're carrying around a giant towering treat filled with the craziest ingredients. A sandwich meter of sorts lets you know when your sandwich has grown large enough to please your alien master. Soon Gourmo starts placing more specific food orders: <+++> Bring me . . . 1 sandwich with a cat! </+++>Â  <---> The </---> particulars of his order are displayed as icons at the top of the screen which are ticked off you collect them. Â  To find the ingredients you must explore the busy levels which include buildings to climb bouncy roofs clothes-lines to cross and water hydrants to smash so you can ride the gushing water into the air. <---> There </---> dissolving clouds larger items to push around locked sections that need a key and even hidden areas to discover. And all this time you're still carrying around a massive sandwich which expands and contracts depending where you are. <---> Once </---> the food is prepared you take it to a waiting alien representative who transports it up to the obese invader Gourmo who devours it hungrily. <---> There </---> an indicator on the screen which always points towards the alien so it easy to find. As the game progresses you're put to the task of building multiple sandwiches as well. <---> When </---> you make a second sandwich your slice of bread gets larger so you can dump bigger fillings on it like crates televisions or satellite dishes. Apparently Gourmo isn't .
