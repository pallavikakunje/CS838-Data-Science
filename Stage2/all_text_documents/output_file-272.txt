<+++> Infinity Blade 2 </+++> [$6. 99] is a step a step or two beyond what was accomplished in the original adding in layers and layers of next-level environmental and character texture detail on top of a ton of fantastic ambient touches -- sharper shadows stronger lighting and a glut of atmospheric effects bolster what already a visual delight especially on iPad 2 and <---> iPhone </---> 4S. In the game opening you'll be whisked to a <---> Japanese </---> garden where pink petals tenderly fall into a pond filled with koi. Later you'll find a fountain with gurgling water creeping over two titanic figures a crypt filled with gigantic ragged rocks with glowing glyphs imbued into them and you'll even observe plenty of nature again as the game new fortress has plenty of aerial life and environmental effects to share. <---> The </---> added oomph of the presentation is a convenient parallel to what going on under the hood. Design-wise this is more <+++> Infinity Blade </+++> except expanded. Beautiful vistas and artfully designed and detailed hallways compose that game more expansive fortress; the guided walking scenes are always punctuated with many more items to loot and fights to be had against increasingly bigger and more complex opponents; also the mystery as to who you are and why you're undying is unraveled more coherently as the writing is now presented with confidence -- it actually wants to tell you a good story. <---> The </---> story element in particular makes <+++> Infinity Blade 2 </+++> a more cohesive game. As in the first you'll be once again stuck in a cyclical play loop forever walking the halls of this new fortress as you puzzle out what it has to offer. <---> But </---> now the protagonist is as aware of his plight as you are and you'll be doing .
