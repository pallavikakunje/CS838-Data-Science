How can hurting kittens be any fun? I mean they truly are the cutest beings ever and yet here I am reviewing a game called <+++> Exploding Kittens </+++> [$1. 99] which I very much enjoy playing. I suppose it somewhat similar to playing <+++> Cards Against Humanity </+++> and making the weirdest most inappropriate card combos just for laughs. But I digress. <+++> Exploding Kittens </+++> is the digital version of the Kickstarter-darling card game with the same name that gone to break all kinds of records. It not the most complex card game but it was never aiming for that; rather the physical version of <+++> Exploding Kittens </+++> bet on the cute art combined with the totally inappropriate theme of hurting cute kittens and managed to deliver a quick fun card game that hits the right balance between being casual and still having enough complexity to keep it interesting after multiple rounds. <---> Enough </---> about the physical game though; what about the digital version? Well I'm glad to say that the game wittiness translates perfectly to the mobile version and actually the digital version manages to surpass the physical one because of the hilarious sound effects that accompany every action. <---> And </---> now that the game finally has online multiplayer (which was the feature I was waiting for before reviewing it) it has become the game I'll often whip out for a round of two and laugh the whole time while playing it. <---> There </---> are a few UI missteps that make playing such a fast-moving game slightly harder than it should have been but despite that <+++> Exploding Kittens </+++> is a blast (definitely pun intended) and it can only get better from here. <---> The </---> game revolves around ensuring you don't draw an Exploding Kitten (EK) card if you .
