The concept is easy to pick up which gels well with its free pricepoint. <---> You </---> play the role of the titular Jetpack Fighter cruising through a futuristic city to destroy evil. <---> Movement </---> and attacks are one and the same allowing you to traverse the air with ease. And basically that it. <---> Level </---> layouts are very similar to a platforming game but you can hover and fly at will to traverse them so they're not particularly tricky. Enemies are scattered about to keep things interesting though and evolve as you make your way across the game story mode map. <+++> Jetpack Fighter </+++> uses a control scheme that feels native to touch devices and only takes a few seconds to learn. <---> There </---> no clunky d-pad -- all you do is swipe at the proper area and said fighter will swoop in that direction -- there no annoying slingshot effect you just move in the direction you want. Since attacking and movement are all in one smooth motion it easy to go anywhere you want on any given map. <---> You </---> can also hold aim and release to trigger a super dash which has unique effects for each character. It adds a strategic element as standing still can put you in harm way but definitely pays off if you can slam into multiple foes. <---> That </---> key too because hitting enemies in rapid succession will ensure that your combo chain is intact. The visual style is bright and cartoony giving off a modern <---> Mega Man </---> (or more recently a <+++> Mighty No. 9 </+++>or <+++> 'Splosion Man </+++>)Â vibe Â complete with enemies that mostly consist of robots. Humanoid boss characters also put up a fight and are the best parts of the game as you're flying through the air trying to battle your equal. <---> Levels </---> .
