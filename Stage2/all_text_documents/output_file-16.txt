Making video game sequels has always been a tricky business but in the modern age of updates and add-ons I can't even imagine how difficult it is to make the best choice for a follow-up. On the <---> App Store </---> in particular the audience has become accustomed to getting reasonably significant additional content delivered as free updates with games like <+++> Angry Birds </+++> [Free] and <+++> Candy Crush Saga </+++> [Free] getting enough free add-ons to construct a dozen sequels under the old rules. Unless you're one of the biggest dogs in the yard however it doesn't take long for such efforts to yield weak dividends since relatively few players ever actually play through all of the content in the base game to begin with. <---> Now </---> if you're making the kind of game where you can make your sequel look obviously different in some regard it less of a problem but for puzzle games it can be difficult to sway people over to a new installment. Generally speaking a great puzzle game almost always comes out of the gate as perfect as its going to be from a feature-set point of view. <---> Adding </---> bombs three dimensions or spheres does nothing but dilute <+++> Tetris </+++> brilliance for example. This is the challenge facing <+++> King Rabbit </+++> [Free] the follow-up to <+++> Furdemption </+++> [$2. 99]. <---> The </---> original game laid out its rules plainly and executed on them with both a high degree of quality and substantial quantity. It was for all intents and purposes the very best <+++> Furdemption </+++> it could be. <---> Now </---> obviously if you just want more levels then that something King Rabbit can deliver to you easily. <---> There </---> are 96 in total here with more promised to come. It quite a lot certainly worth the minimal .
