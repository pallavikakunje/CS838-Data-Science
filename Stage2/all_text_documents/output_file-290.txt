The first rally racing game I played was SEGA <+++> SEGA Rally Championship </+++> on the SEGA Saturn. To tell the truth before that game I wasn't a huge racing game fan. I'd play the odd game at the arcades and I'd certainly join in on a race or two with my friends on their games but it wasn't a genre I was terribly interested in. <---> In </---> fact <+++> SEGA Rally </+++> wasn't even my first choice for a game the day I bought it. I had wanted <+++> Virtua Fighter 2 </+++> but the shop was sold out so instead I brought home a racing game. I fell in love with that game and it served as a gateway to the whole sub-genre of rally racing for me. Games like <+++> V-Rally </+++> <+++> Colin McRae </+++> <+++> Rallisport Challenge </+++> and WRC became regular purchases for me even as I continued to almost entirely ignore every other kind of racer. <---> There </---> just something about this type of racing that speaks to me. When I started playing heavily on <---> iOS </---> however I couldn't quite find a rally racing game that did everything I wanted one to do. Eventually <+++> Colin McRae Rally </+++> [$2. 99] arrived and my hopes were high but while it nailed the physics the content was severely lacking. <---> It </---> did the job but I continued to hope something better would arrive someday. <---> That </---> day is finally here. <+++> Rush Rally 2 </+++> [$0. 99] offers great physics lots of tracks a variety of play modes and even some silly extras all for one up-front price with no IAP. Incredibly this game was made by a small team of only a few people. Sometimes I can't believe what we get on iOS for such meager prices .
