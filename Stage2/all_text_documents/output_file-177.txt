It sometimes easy to forget how far mobile gaming has come in such a short time. <---> Not </---> even 10 years ago people playing phone games were using ill-suited keypads to move sluggish characters around simple environments to fill the time while they waited for the bus. Almost none of the big game companies had their eye on the ball and that left an opportunity for a bunch of smaller guys to get a lot more attention far more easily than they can today. <---> As </---> an example just look at <+++> Sky Force </+++>. Originally released in 2004 developed by a four-person team in <---> Poland </---> <+++> Sky Force </+++> enjoyable mix of 1942 enemy patterns and <+++> Raiden </+++>-like visuals made it a big winner among early mobile gamers. It later enjoyed an enhanced port to other smartphones with a choice of tilt or touch-based controls and a lot of features that were interesting at the time like <---> Open </---> Feint. Like all too many games of that vintage <---> iOS </---> updates eventually left <+++> Sky Force </+++> behind sadly. You can't keep a good ship grounded however so <+++> Sky Force </+++> has made its return in the surely-never-to-be-outdated <+++> Sky Force 2014 </+++> [Free]. <---> Rather </---> than just get the old game up and running again developer Infinite Dreams has done a top-to-bottom remake/sequel that reflects that most wonderful year of 2014 in every possible way. You'll see a lot of familiar sights on this new adventure but even the things you've seen before have a whole new look to them. <---> The </---> gameplay has also seen some changes some of which could be described as contentious though not nearly as bad as they seem. It even got a hot 2014 price available for the fantastic price of free. <---> Hey </---> no come back it .
