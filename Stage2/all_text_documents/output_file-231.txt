As a rule I try not to buy early access games unless I absolutely feel the need to. <+++> Particle Mace </+++> [$2. 99] on desktop was one of those games I stayed away from but always had in my mind: the concept seemed intriguing plus it was iOS bound sometime down the road. <---> As </---> such when I found out that the game was leaving early access and releasing for iOS I was extremely excited. One I like seeing games actually leaving early access and becoming finished products because early access trades on respecting your customer and delivering on the promise that you're finishing what you started as a developer. <---> Early </---> access can be a really great thing for developers and for players but when developers use it as an excuse to just make money off of unfinished games it saddening. Two I was excited to actually play the game without compromising my principles. I'm willing to bend them when I feel like it so I'm perhaps not the person to listen to but I stick to it more often than not. <---> Well </---> <+++> Particle Mace </+++> was well worth the wait. And the developer <---> Andy Makes Games </---> was smart in tweaking the game to fit iOS. <+++> Particle Mace </+++> puts you in control of a ship that has a series of maces tethered to it. As such your goal is to fly around swinging the mace and mastering the physics in order to bash enemies and asteroids which populate the game playing field the asteroids splitting into smaller rocks when hit. <---> There </---> are multiple ships with different behaviors so you not only have to learn how to fly the ship around you have to use the tethered mace to your advantage. Flying around in circles can swing it .
