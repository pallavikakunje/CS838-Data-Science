Sometimes a game can grab my attention immediately. <---> Â Whether </---> it the presentation or the ironclad mechanics very few developers are skilled enough to really blow me away out of the gate. Â  <+++> Beneath the Lighthouse </+++> [Free] was one of those games. I was drawn in by the <+++> Fez </+++>-like art style and stayed for the gameplay. <---> At </---> first glance <+++> Lighthouse </+++> looks like just another art game but don't be fooled by its small intro scene which features a boy (of sorts) being tortured by birds and thrown into a chasm of seemingly no return. It might look like something that warrants hours of exposition but in reality it an action puzzler of sorts. <---> Â Your </---> job is to guide the boy through a series of tunnels by shifting the screen around in a circular fashion. He an object essentially at your disposal and will fall wherever gravity takes him. <---> Because </---> of this <+++> Lighthouse </+++> is deliciously easy to control as all you have to do is swipe towards a spoke on the wheel and the screen will shift accordingly. Of course you'll need to take a bit to get used to the momentum and physics involved which feel spot-on and arcade-like in a good way. <---> The </---> controls are responsive and it easy to get a feel for the game without feeling like it constantly cheating you which is great as the hazards are plentiful. As a note it not tilt-based. <---> Â The </---> theme that permeates throughout <+++> Lighthouse </+++> is unexpected bliss. The soundtrack is better than I thought it would be the art is bright and colorful throughout and the controls never feel rigid even as the game adds more concepts. It doesn't mess around either because by the time you get to level 17 it .
