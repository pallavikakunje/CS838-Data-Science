While deep engrossing mobile experiences have been somewhat downplayed by the general public everyone knows that as far as quick fixes go the platform is king. <+++> Dashy Crashy </+++> [Free] is yet another take on the success of <+++> Crossy Road </+++> all the way down to its monetization scheme but it a perfect example of a stop and go game that easy to pick up and hard to put down. <---> The </---> game starts off in the simplest of ways -- on a crowded road. You'll likely crash in the first few seconds getting into the swing of things but figuring out your car capabilities are a cinch. You can basically swerve back and forth between lanes accelerate and brake. <---> It </---> sounds shallow at first but once you really dig into it the nuances start to creep up on you. For instance acceleration flicks are very touchy to the point where you can continuously rev the engine by swiping upwards constantly. <+++> Crashy </+++> operates on a loop of sorts as an endless experience but there plenty of different locales patterns and even a day and night cycle to help break things up. <---> There </---> nothing truly crazy here like highways on another planet or anything but it gets the job done. What I really like though is how active <---> Crashy </---> is when it comes to player interaction. It almost OCD-like in nature but the game is constantly communicating with you and giving you something else to deal with. <---> Whether </---> it pesky cars swerving into you hazard lanes that have car chases interrupt your run or cars zipping by with emojis explaining their mood (and other players asynchronously) it can get busy on-screen. It adds to the charm as things can get rather hectic constantly keeping players on their toes. .
