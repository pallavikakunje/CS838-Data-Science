As readers of this site know well there are a lot of games that get lost in the shuffle on the <---> App </---> Store. With tens of thousands of new apps every year it like sifting through a haystack the size of a barn in search of a handful of needles trying to find all the good games. <---> There </---> are lots of ways to get a heads-up on many of these titles and one resource that has always served me well is our very own forum. <+++> Super Splatform </+++> [$1. 99] from P1XL the developers of <+++> RPG Quest Minimae </+++> [$1. 99] and 4NR [$1. 99] is one of those games that bounced right by me initially. It has a very unassuming look to it as I suppose is the norm for this developer. The game central gimmick carries it far however and the increasingly devilish level designs bring it all the way home. <---> You </---> will curse this game out you will wail in despair at every last minute fumble and you will go back for more every time. If you've played <+++> Bean Quest </+++> [$2. 99] <+++> Super Splatform </+++> follows a similar stage-based auto-jumping idea. <---> You </---> control a ball with a smiley face who is constantly hopping and you need to bring the little guy to a specially marked goal platform to clear each stage. Depending on how many jumps it takes you to reach it you'll earn a gold silver or bronze clear status. <---> There </---> also a single gold coin found in each stage that you'll usually have to go out of the way to collect. If you manage to gold clear the stage and collect that coin a rainbow coin will appear in that level. <---> Collecting </---> the rainbow coin completely clears the stage once .
