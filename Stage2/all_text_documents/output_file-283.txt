There no way to avoid this: <+++> Gesundheit! </+++> [$2. 99 / $2. 99 (HD)] is gross. <---> It </---> a game about sneezing and snot features heavily. But it not a game defined by disgust. <---> The </---> gross-out factor stuck with me for the first level or two and after that I only noticed how whimsical and well-formed it is. <---> You </---> play a wee green pig whose allergies keep him apart from his fellows. But when monsters invade it turns out his biggest weakness is also his biggest strength. <---> The </---> monsters just love to eat the one weapon at his disposal: his snot. Blech. To save his city and his piggy friends he'll need to use that advantage to lure the monsters into traps without getting eaten himself. <---> If </---> the pig is seen by the monsters they'll come straight for him but they can always be distracted with a big juicy sneeze. This means piggy needs to engage in guerrilla warfare hiding behind buildings and bushes and leading monsters to their deaths. I love these stealth elements. When you know you'll have to leave the shadows you'll have to strategize - make sure there a snot-ball in just the right place to lure the monsters away and then dart behind a building before they're done with it. <---> The </---> puzzles are varied and most can be approached in different ways. Throughout the game you'll encounter several environmental features that you can use to get more out of your sneezes. <---> Certain </---> flowers give you super-powered snot balls and grasses let you use your sneezes like a grappling hook. Sneezing across a teleporter has interesting results. <---> And </---> some of the monsters provide special challenges requiring you to quietly rethink your strategy. All the puzzles are thoughtful affairs though they occasionally require you to think on .
