In <+++> Plants vs. Zombies </+++> <---> Popcap </---> takes the standard tower defense formula and greatly simplifies it. Instead of a path to build towers along you drop seeds in your yard which then grow in to plants that have various offensive or defensive capabilities. <---> The </---> yard is organized in a grid and zombies move straight across the row they spawn on munching (or in some cases jumping or flying over) anything that they come in contact with. A gauge on the top of the screen shows how close you are to the end of the level with flags indicating when big waves of zombies are going to come. <---> When </---> you clear a stage you're often awarded with the seeds of one more of the nearly 50 included plants. This seemingly constant progression does a great job of keeping you interested as it always seems like you have a new toy to play with. <---> To </---> shake things up even more mini game levels are mixed in including a bowling game of sorts a whack-a-mole game with zombies and others. Originally designed to be played with a mouse <---> Popcap </---> did an excellent job of porting <+++> Plants vs. Zombies </+++> to the iPhone. The resource required to build your defenses is sunlight and in the PC version feverishly moving your mouse around to click on the small suns falling from the top of the screen got tiring (especially when playing on a laptop with a touchpad). On the <---> iPhone </---> the sunlight mechanic is also in place but seems to work so much better when you only have to tap the falling suns to collect them. Interface elements have been made smaller to dedicate more screen space to your yard and some things have been moved around. <---> Your </---> available seeds have been moved .
