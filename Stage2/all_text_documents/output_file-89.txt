Laser Dog Games' <+++> Hopiko </+++> [$1. 99] is a title I've been dying to see come to fruition since I first saw it and played it. The preview build I got to try had some real promise but the game has come so far along that it become this amazing cohesive and stylish experience. It a demanding game and one with some flaws but <+++> Hopiko </+++> is too cool to pass up. <---> This </---> is a speedrun platformer of sorts except your goal is to jump from platform to platform in an environment where you stick to whatever is safe to land on. You can tap to jump directly up off of whatever you've landed on (up being relative to your character) or swipe to fly in a certain direction trying to get to the end of the level. <---> Levels </---> are arranged in runs of 5 and you have to complete all 5 levels in a run to advance with several stages full of 10 runs and a super-challenging bonus run to complete. All of this in the name of saving video games from creatures who have corrupted video games and I don't mean the writers over at Polygon. <+++> Hopiko </+++> is all about speed. It a speedrun game and each level gives you a goal time to beat it in to get the check mark for that level sure. <---> But </---> also most platforms explode if you sit on them too long and making timely jumps lets you fly faster through the air and it just plain feels better to go fast. But this game makes going fast feel good and not just be an optional part of the experience. <---> You </---> gotta go fast. Go full Sanic. <---> While </---> for some games like the upcoming <+++> Mos Speedrun 2 .
