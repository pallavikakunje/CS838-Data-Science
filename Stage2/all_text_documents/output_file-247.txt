<+++> XCOM: Enemy Unknown </+++> is a game about story. And not just the scripted overarching pulp-y sci-fi one that it tells. <---> But </---> the one you weave on battlefield tapestries as you gather enough resources to engage the alien threat. Your choices your losses your wins inform the experience shaping a bigger picture that basically unique to you. <---> While </---> <+++> Enemy Unknown </+++> is a winner both mechanically and technically it this triumph in design that makes it worth a shot on any platform that it on -- including the awesome new iOS version. <---> You </---> can break down <+++> Enemy Unknown </+++> into two distinct parts the latter of which would make a great iPad game all on its own. <---> There </---> the tactical turn-based shooter part that has you assigning a group of marines to most of the time engage alien activity. With touch gestures taps and clicks on the UI you command each marine in battle slowly creeping into a fog of war that veils the alien threat. There several different classes of dude and all have their own unique abilities. <---> Snipers </---> for instance can fire from a distance that a basic bullet-spewing Heavy would have a zero percent change of hitting from. <---> Most </---> fights boil down to insanely tactical skirmishes which hinge on your ability to set up and bunker down into smart firing positions with each dude covering the other. As alien bad guys lumber or scuttle into the picture your commander-ness will be tested; enemies are smart and lethal: you will lose guys. <---> This </---> is just the harsh reality of XCOM. And losing folks will hurt too since your dudes earn experience and abilities if they manage to make it out of battles alive. <---> Every </---> recruit starts out as a rookie that slowly gains an identity .
