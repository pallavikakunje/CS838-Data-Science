Blake Pattersonâs review of the original <+++> Train Conductor </+++> [$2. 99] on <---> Touch Arcade </---> remarked that it was âlike <+++> Flight Control </+++> [R. I. P. ] on railsâ. Thatâs certainly the feeling I got from playing the latest game in the series as well. <+++> Train Conductor World </+++> [Free] truly feels like a blast from the past with its central mechanic of routing things around the screen with swipes as I probably had at least five or six games on my phone back in the day that were heavily inspired by Firemintâs classic airplane game. I canât remember the last time I played something like that and itâs a heck of a lot of fun revisiting similar ideas in <+++> World </+++>. Of course this is no longer 2009 and the <---> App Store </---> is a very different place now. Can The Voxel Agentsâ cute little trains keep <---> up?The </---> first time you play the game you may be forgiven for thinking itâs a bit too easy. After all the trains move slowly and you can even stop them with a tap if things get a out of hand. <---> Eventually </---> though things ramp up quite a bit. If you pass a level âperfectlyâ (more on that in a second) youâll unlock a harder difficulty where everything moves faster and the game gets shockingly challenging once youâve sunk a few hours into it. <---> The </---> tile system is definitely there to gently pressure you into spending money but itâs not bad. Iâve already unlocked eight locations without spending a dime and Iâm having a grand olâ time playing through them over and over. There are also ads in the game including opt-in videos to continue a level once youâve crashed but they donât get in the way too much and you .
