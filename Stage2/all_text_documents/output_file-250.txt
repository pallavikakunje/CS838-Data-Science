The premise of <+++> Ridiculous Fishing </+++> [$2. 99] is identical to that of its <+++> Radical </+++> predecessor: <---> You </---> start the game by casting your line into the water then you tilt your device to control where your lure is in the water. Ideally you want to get as deep as possible avoiding all forms of aquatic life. <---> The </---> first time you collide with something the music gets reversed and you start reeling in your line. At this point the goal is reversed in that you want to collect as many fish as possible similarly by tilting. <---> Anything </---> that hits your lure gets picked up and once you break the surface of the water things get really crazy- You actually catch fish by shooting them with whatever firearm you have equipped at the time. <---> Each </---> of them behave a little differently so you might be tapping or sliding your finger around to kill fish. On top of the basic mechanic(s) of the game rides a persistent upgrade system where you're earning money from your catches and then spending it on different upgrades ranging from new line to fish deeper new weapons to kill more effectively and more. <---> Of </---> particular interest is the ability to add both a toaster and a hair dryer to your line to negate two accidental collisions to fish even deeper. You eventually get a err chainsaw-type attachment to add to your lure allowing you to dash through fish to get even further underwater. <---> The </---> way all of these upgrades build on top of each other feels great as <+++> Ridiculous Fishing </+++> totally gives off almost <+++> Doodle Jump </+++>-like I could play this forever vibes while providing the whole <---> Aww </---> man I only need $1000 more for this next item to keep you playing .
