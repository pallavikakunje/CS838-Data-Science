Many of us dream of saving the world but few really get that opportunity. <+++> Pandemic: The Board Game </+++> [$6. 99] is a cooperative board game that tasks you with stopping four deadly diseases before they consume the world. <---> It </---> has already been a blockbuster on tabletops attracting the likes of Wil Wheaton and now it taking the <---> App Store </---> by storm. This first time effort from developer F2Z has a lot riding on it. Letâs see if it lives up to expectations. In <+++> Pandemic </+++> you or a group of friends control a team of CDC officers as they work to stop the spread of four diseases. Each officer has a specific role and special ability that you will call upon as you travel the world. <---> The </---> game takes place across a map of the world depicting several cities. Cubes represent infections in these cities and if there are ever three or more cubes in a city and another infection happens it will spread to the neighboring cities (called an outbreak) perhaps causing a chain reaction; donât let this happen. <---> Each </---> officer takes four actions a turn which they can use to move around the board treat a disease in a city (remove a cube) give a card to another player cure a disease and more. They then draw two cards which represent cities in the game and also have a color matching one of the four diseases. <---> It </---> takes five of the same color disease card to create a cure and the only way to win is to cure all four diseases. Sadly there are many more ways to lose. <---> Each </---> turn new cities receive infections that can cause outbreaks; get eight outbreaks and you lose. You can also lose if too much of one disease .
