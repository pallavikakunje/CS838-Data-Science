A long time ago by <---> App Store </---> standards anyway a unique puzzle game named <+++> Shibuya </+++> released on iPhone. Said to be inspired by the neon lights and the tall buildings of <---> Tokyo </---> famous Shibuya district it also seemed to be following in the footsteps of stylish puzzle games like <+++> Lumines </+++> and <+++> Meteos </+++> produced by Q Entertainment. The game got a lot of acclaim and a few updates but it eventually fell behind the times and was pulled from the <---> App </---> Store. I had kind of thought we'd seen the last of it until I got word from the developer that <+++> Shibuya </+++> was returning better than ever. <+++> Shibuya Grandmaster </+++> [$0. 99] is a well-crafted update to the original bringing modern features and style to the game while still offering up a strong and unusual twist on falling block puzzles. It a bit hard to figure out what going on in <+++> Shibuya </+++> from screenshots. <---> The </---> core gameplay involves filling falling blocks with various colors to create combinations of two or more that you can clear from the screen. The blocks will fall at a steady pace whether you paint them or not and while you can see the order of the next few colors you'll be able to use you're unable to switch that order around. <---> Once </---> an empty block has fallen in place you can't paint it and it can only be removed by making a match immediately above or below it. Survival involves planning ahead and often painting blocks that are higher on the screen. <---> Getting </---> a great score on the other hand involves that delightful sort of dancing on the edge of a knife approach that gives <+++> Tetris </+++> the long-term bite it enjoys. You see if .
