Every time <---> Nitrome </---> announces a new game I get excited for two reasons. <---> One </---> is that I love pixel art games and <---> Nitrome </---> specializes in them. Second is that their games are usually pretty cool in some way have some twist to them that interesting to discover. <+++> Silly Sausage in Meat Land </+++> [Free] is their latest and one of their best games that I've played yet. <---> It </---> a goofy and challenging game that does some really cool things. You control a very stretchy sausage-y dog who must make it through 50 'levels' signified by checkpoints as the game is technically one gigantic level doing so by stretch from point to point. <---> You </---> can stretch out endlessly in any of the cardinal directions trying to reach a piece of terrain that you can latch on to which pulls your entire body to that spot. While you're stretched out your entire body is vulnerable so you need to be careful and/or quick to get to safety. <---> Thankfully </---> if you attach to a spot your body as it snaps back together will be invincible so you don't have to worry about dying that way which prevents the game from feeling at all unfair. You're entirely in control of this wiener dog and you can even reverse course by swiping back in the direction you came from which becomes necessary for many of the obstacles in the game. This isn't really a puzzle-platformer or a 'platformer' at all but there not really a neat genre classification for <+++> Silly Sausage in Meat Land </+++>. <---> The </---> challenges require a bit of thought to find the ideal path for some of them but it as much about formulating the simple-enough plan and then executing it. The game does throw a good variety of challenges .
