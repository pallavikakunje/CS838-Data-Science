I've played so many runners in the past 10 years or so I've lost count. Much like my teenage years after I realized that I had played hundreds of platformers in my lifetime over time I started to notice that you can't really browse the App Store without seeing a runner front and center. <---> While </---> many groan at the prospect I relish a new opportunity to check out aÂ new entry and a brand new way to spend entire days wasting away behind the comfort of a touchscreen. <---> The </---> space is filled with a ton of classics and is steadily forging a new playstyle that conducive to touch controls. Whereas many thought that some of these games weren't previously possible clever developers have fine-tuned devices so that they're not only easy to pickup but tough to master. <---> That </---> basically describes <+++> Chameleon Run </+++> [$1. 99] to a tee. Based on one simple concept -- swapping colors -- <+++> Chameleon Run </+++> succeeds at sucking you in at minute one. <---> The </---> gist is that at the start players are presented with two colors yellow and purple with the option to swap between them at will. Touching an opposite color will end your turn so it your job to swap constantly to accommodate. <---> Â To </---> do this you'll tap one side of the screen to swap and the other to jump -- told you it was simple!It crazy just how fast you can swap if you're quick enough as each touch will instantly switch colors -- a useful mechanic for when you forget to swap at the very last moment. <---> Â After </---> some practice it'll be a second nature and swapping back and forth will allow you to conquer every obstacle thrown at you. Well just about everything as you still need to dodge .
