If you loved <---> Loren </---> Brichterâs classic multiplayer word game Letterpress but for some reason you want a single-player version of it then <---> Italian </---> developers Marco Torretta and <---> Stefano Figurelli </---> have something to show you: Lettercraft. This isÂ a wordsearch game played on a five-by-five grid of tiled letters which you click in sequence to form words. <---> The </---> longer the word the higher the score. Each level has a target score and it worth lingeringÂ to find the long words because a couple of 8- or 9-letter words can earn you top marks straightaway. <---> Quickly </---> tapping away with 4- and 5-letter words won't do much for yourÂ scoreline. What makes the game really fun is the timer. <---> See </---> all tiles start out light blue but after a while they heat up to teal then green orange etc. If a tile gets past red then it disappears. <---> You </---> can cool a tile down by using it in a word but if you form an invalid word then all the tiles you've used heat up. You need to keep your tiles cool while trying to get the longest possible word while all the time aware that the clock is ticking. <---> It </---> subtle but this sheen of tension across the wordsearch mechanic creates a single-player word game that is exciting to play. As you move through the levels rules are introduced such as all words must have the letter A in them or only words with five or more letters are valid. Again this injects just that little bit of extra pressure and it motivates you to concentrate harder and get those words locked in as fast as you can. <---> There </---> is a multiplayer component too but you don't actually compete against each other you just try to survive longer than your opponent. There no stealing of .
