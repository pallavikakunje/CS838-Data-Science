<+++> Wizards and Wagons </+++>[$4. 99] is out now from Touch Dimensions and it is one of the more active and engaging item shop sim games I have played. Known for more traditional strategy games <---> Touch Dimensions </---> is stretching their dev skills to reach into the sim genre. Rather than sitting in town and waiting for customers to come to you W&W mobilizes the store and puts you in the drivers seat. As last week <---> Touch Arcade Game </---> of the Week I was not surprised to find dynamic gameplay and an addictive quality that has put some extra rings under my eyes for the last several days from lack of sleep. <---> As </---> a wandering merchant your main goal is to make loads of money. By evaluating the supply and demand of each town in the game you can buy low at a town selling goods then travel to a town in need of those goods and sell high. <---> Simple </---> enough right? As your cart rumbles down the road you will have to fight off bandits and monsters intent on stealing your stash and destroying your house on 4 wheels. <---> This </---> is where the action component kicks in. Depending on the town you are travelling to you might end up killing a few lowly slimes or having squads of attackers hurling themselves at your cart(and possibly killing you). <---> The </---> starting weapon you get a standard bow is actually really effective as long as you can tap the screen quickly but there is a large selection of ranged and melee weapons you can equip on your cart to beef up your trail blazing ability. This part of the game is kind of like a rail shooter with the cart following a pre-set path and you responsible for aiming your attacks to dispatch .
