Then in late <---> July </---> nearly five months after the game announcement we finally learned that EA Mobile had picked up <+++> Reckless Racing </+++> and would be publishing the title for Pixelbite. <---> This </---> was good news as it meant the game hadn't been cancelled but we were still left without a solid release date. Meanwhile the hype continued to swell in our forums to an astronomical degree as the weeks again began to pass without any sign of <+++> Reckless Racing </+++>. <---> Then </---> just this past week EA announced that the game would finally be coming out on <---> October </---> 21st and there was much rejoicing. Common sense would tell us that practically no game could match the incredible amount of hype that <+++> Reckless Racing </+++> has garnered in the past 7 and a half months but casting that aside now that the final game is in our hands we can at least say that this is an incredibly enjoyable top-down arcade racing experience â just as we had hoped it would be. <---> It </---> definitely feels lacking in terms of track and vehicle options especially taking into account the long development time but what is here is super high quality and becomes an easier pill to swallow thanks to a really reasonable price point. Like many of the best games on a mobile platform the biggest problem with <+++> Reckless Racing </+++> is that there just isn't enough of it. <---> Upon </---> starting the single player game you are thrust into a simple but very useful tutorial. Here you can choose from one of the five different control schemes (that include various onscreen buttons virtual steering wheels or tilt controls) and test them out to your heart content on a practice track until you've found the one that suits you. <---> Â Quitting </---> .
