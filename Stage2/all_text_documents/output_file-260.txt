One of my favorite games of the past few years on PC is <+++> Crypt of the NecroDancer </+++> [$4. 99] a rhythmic roguelike that I tried out with a friend and I fell in love with the whole concept of the game. It a roguelike where movement is set to the beat of a fantastic soundtrack by <---> Danny Baranowsky </---> with the idea being that the entire game can be controlled by the four directional inputs on a <+++> Dance Dance Revolution </+++> dance pad. After enjoying my first time with the game I rushed out and bought the game with its soundtrack on Steam. I played a lot of <+++> Crypt of the NecroDancer </+++> at various times but probably less than I really wanted to because the game was on PC. I'm on my computer a lot but usually working or looking up stupid stuff just listening to music or whatnot. What I would have killed for would have been a mobile version of the game so that I could play it on my couch like other games. I love mobile in large part because I can take my games and play them wherever without worrying about plugging in my PC to my TV. <---> Or </---> if I want to play a game while a baseball game is on the TV in the background I can do that with ease. So I kind of fell out of love with <+++> Crypt of the NecroDancer </+++>. . . until the recent mobile release. There a lot to love here but this is a game you have to instabuy as it just so much fun and bursting at the seams with content and replayability. <---> The </---> best way to think of <+++> Crypt of the NecroDancer </+++> and how it works is .
