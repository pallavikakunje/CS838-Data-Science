Even though I should know better by now I still frequently make judgements from the names of games. <---> An </---> evocative title will catch my attention and get me curious enough to at least give a game a try while a generic one might leave a game lost in the shuffle. It especially a problem on a platform with as many on-going releases as iOS. <+++> Super Happy Fun Block </+++> [$0. 99] has a pretty plain name. <---> It </---> so plain that even after it was recommended to me by someone whose opinion I really respect I downloaded the game and left it unplayed for a while. When I finally did get around to it I found a pretty amazing puzzle-platformer with a nice sense of style that few people seem to have noticed. Well hopefully the old adage about late being better than never has some truth to it because while the name might be bland the game is fantastic and more people ought to be playing it. <---> You </---> play as a little ball-shaped character with arms and legs named Ball who lives in a world that consists of only black and white until the day the blocks arrive. <---> Malicious </---> and in some cases deadly these invading blocks are both your obstacles and your tools. In each stage of the game you'll be searching for a certain number of stars and the exit. <---> Some </---> of the stars will be on the main path but most of them will require you to do some thinking and the occasional quick bit of action-platforming to reach. The set-up works a bit like <+++> Super Mario 64 </+++> in that you need a certain number of stars to open up the next world. <---> There </---> are four worlds in total with some extra secret levels .
