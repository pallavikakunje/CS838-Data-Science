What do you look for in a game? <---> Is </---> it brief moments of entertainment? Do you like games that keep you busy while you play them and fade from memory the moment you stop? <---> Then </---> <+++> Football Manager Touch 2016 </+++> [$19. 99 (HD)] is definitely not for you. Why so? <---> Because </---> this is a game about investment a game that hooks you not with its frantic gameplay (since it anything but frantic) but by getting you involved and invested in your career. The game makes you feel like an integral part of team your managing; you don't play FMT 2016 only when you're looking at your tablet you're playing it even late at night in a bar when you're thinking which player would work where or whether that wonderkid will finally turn up on matchday. This is a game that will literally expand to fill much of your free time even when you aren't actually anywhere near your tablet. <---> While </---> the game will entertain every player who enjoys deep management games it truly shines when you actually know football and follow it. Why? Because there a sense of vindication when playing FMT 2016 that I don't think I've ever gotten from another game. <---> When </---> that no-name player you got into your digital team at the beginning of the year ends up becoming a big signing for a real-life big team merely a few months later then you can proudly say I called it. <---> Outside </---> the 'moral satisfaction' that such moments bring they also show the game realism in terms of player representation another reason why playing this game and watching the real sport end up merging together in a fabulous amalgam of sports entertainment. Some might complain that we are getting another premium-priced <+++> Football Manager </+++> game too .
