The first thing that happens in Telltale Gamesâ <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++> [Free] is that Sheriff Bigby Wolf talks to a toad in a cardigan. The second thing, at least for me, was that he gets beaten to death (twice). Apparent cause of death isÂ an axe handle through the eye socket, but Iâm no doctor. Thatâs a hell of a first impression for the series, adapted from Bill Willinghamâs Fables franchise. FablesâÂ premiseâthat fairytale characters have come to live in the real-world Bronxâisnât uncommon: The 10th Kingdom and Neil Gaimanâs American Gods both predate Willingham, and contemporary shows like Once Upon A Time and Sleepy Hollow continue the unevenly handled tradition.The violence inÂ this introduction stands out as a way to overcompensate for <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++>â inherent silliness, to convince us that itâs brutal and dark. The overwhelmingly grisly murder that sets the game in motion only reinforces that idea.The bloody posturing is unnecessary, as the <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++> has enough grit and texture to stand on its own without drawn-out fight scenes or swear words. The game draws its tension and mood from Fabletownâs deep violets and navy blues, from a dusky soundtrack, from punchy voice-acting. The racism and classism that undergird the world of Fables are both sadder and more desperate than the blood and broken bones Telltale chooses to highlight first.
Still, Telltale are remarkably efficient alchemists when it comes to Willinghamâs setting. They have an ear for dialogue and a genuine knack for plotting and pacing, but the promise of exploring more of the beautifully realized Fabletown is compelling too. Bigbyâs melodrama aside, <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++> would still be interesting as a political parable, and if thereâs one criticism, itâs that Telltale keeps the reigns too tight and doesnât offer enough chances to poke at the seams of Fabletown.Adventure games usually handle cop stories well: You talk to people, gather clues, and make connections. Bigby does those things in <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++>, too, but they donât culminate in some solved puzzle as much as they change the tone and texture of Bigbyâs relationships with other characters.In other words, this is a narrative experience, and the gameâs whodunit is a plot device, not a game mechanic. Collecting evidence may unlock new dialog options, but its main purpose is to deepen the gameâs mystery and to force Bigby to make decisions. That said, the choices players make over the course of <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++>âsome small, some largeâform the gameâs backbone, and every interaction seems to tie into Telltaleâs narrative Rubikâs Cube.Unfortunately, performance problems on older devices like the iPad 2 crop up with regularity. Stuttering frame rates and delayed inputs make for shambolic action scenes and disrupted cinematics, and <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++> suffers from general instability and locks up often. These technical problems are a black spot on an otherwise gorgeous game, especially since it depends on smart camera work and pacing to sustain its story.Episode 1 â FaithEarly in this episode, Sheriff Bigby explains to Colin that he keeps the peace in Fabletown âby being big, and being bad.â Itâs on the nose, but Colinâs response cuts to the heart of <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++>: âDonât say that shit in front of people. Itâs embarrassing.âColin is decrying Bigbyâs chest-thumping, but itâs a nice reminder that the characters in Fabletown have pre-conceived notions about Bigby, that those notions can change based on player input, and the this is primarily a game about exploring relationships in a fairytale society.âFaithââs strongest scene occurs in a library, where routine bureaucracy comes face-to-face with fairytale magical fantasy. There are signs of ârealâ lifeâa deputy mayor, an administrator, public health and birth recordsâjuxtaposed with a magic lamp and an omniscient talking mirror. Itâs just enough to remind of you of Fablesâ allegorical potential while still breathing life into a mysterious new environment.Like in Telltaleâs previous series, <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++> âremembersâ certain choices and uses them to shape the story to come. This is an increasingly common narrative trick, but Iâm skeptical of games that notify the player so obviously when it happens. Granted, âFaithâ is only the first of five episodes, so itâs hard to see if and how Bigbyâs kindness toward, say, Bufkin will play out. Whatâs clearer already is that Bigbyâs character, his relationships, and âFaithââs plot points are highly malleable.<+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++>â surveillance seems like it would extend to the quick-time events that govern its fights. Bigbyâs potential for ultraviolence rears its head more than once in âFaith,â and his restraintâor lack thereofâshould have narrative repercussions. It doesnât.The QTEs themselves are straightforward taps, flicks, and swipes. One pleasant surprise is how flexible they are: you can miss a few prompts without failing, and the fights are choreographed well enough that everything flows naturally, even when a punch or headbutt is flubbed or skipped on purpose.Hereâs the rub: itâs not always clear what a given QTE will do, or which ones can be skipped without losing the fight. This has an unfortunate chilling effect on roleplaying. In one early fight, Bigby steals an axe while a QTE prompt hovers near his opponentâs neck. Thinking his next move would be to decapitate someone, I skipped it and failed the fight. I was punished for playing Bigby less violently than Telltale intended.Turns out, Bigby merely breaks the guyâs jaw, but thatâs beside the point. When Bigby talks to people, Telltale encourages us to roleplay, to make decisions that have lasting consequences; when heâs fighting someone, we get bottlenecked along a narrow path.Almost every game mechanic in âFaithâ builds upon, changes, or informs some aspect of the narrative. With one enormous, climactic exception, the fight scenes in âFaithâ donât. Our choices in âFaithâ matter in one context but not the other, and thatâs jarring.Nevertheless, âFaithâ puts forward a dense tale that excels at building momentum. Hereâs to sustainability.
Episode 2 â Smoke & MirrorsThe two-month gap between âFaithâ and âSmoke & Mirrorsâ is felt right away: the finer plot points get lost in the shuffle of new characters, and âSmokeâ struggles to find a rhythm as players try to remember whoâs who and why theyâre interrogating the Woodsman.âSmokeâ eventually settles into itself, but itâs a much shorter episode than âFaith.â Its brevity is compounded by the way Telltale shunts us from one scene to the next. For example, Bigby examines a headless torso early in the episode. There are several clues and interaction points to explore, but one in particular triggers Deputy Mayor Ichabod Crane to swoop in like hideous bird to shoo Bigby out of the room.You wonât get another crack at the body, even if there are other clues to gather, and the implication is clear: moving the story forward is more important than investigating. Itâs frustrating that âSmokeâ curtails a chance to do something both the character and mechanics are ostensibly suited for, especially since the investigation in Toadâs apartment worked so well in âFaith.âThat same pressure to move quickly exerts itself through the timed dialogue system that Telltale has been using since <+++> The Walking Dead </+++>. This design makes sense in the context of a zombie apocalypse, but this episode never earns the sense of urgency imposed onto it.Where âFaithâ is violent, âSmokeâ is seedy, taking Bigby through a strip club, brothel, and flop hotel in short order. Itâs unclear if this slum tourism supports a good faith effort to explore the social ills at the foundation of the Fables series, but Bigby seems poised to act as the blunt force needed to clear a path for much-needed reforms. By that same token, thereâs an undercurrent of class guilt and noblesse oblige in the episodeâs most lurid scenes.That doesnât keep the scene between Bigby and Holly from being the best in the episode. Not only does it encapsulate the gameâs class tension, but it also delivers on Telltaleâs promise of a reactive and responsive gameworld. Holly and Grendel both appreciate that I-as-Bigby decided against ripping Grendelâs arm off. Indeed, the relationship between the player, Bigby, and the other denizens of Fabletown continues to be a highlight of <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++>.More violent interactions are subtler, too. In the opening scene of âFaith,â Bigby is forced to pummel the Woodsman, whether the player wants to or not. Near the end of âSmoke & Mirrors,â Bigby again finds himself in a brawl. This fight scene is more flexible, however, and weâre allowed to lay off if need be. Bigbyâs restraint doesnât go unnoticed, thankfully.Still, âSmoke & Mirrorsâ is more often interesting than riveting, consigned to doing <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++>â dirty work: it moves the plot forward in ways that are necessary but not compelling, and touches on the series themes without revealing its hand too early. Itâs a short, workmanlike episode, content to stand on âFaithââs back and prep us for whatâs next.
Episode 3 â A Crooked MileBy episode three, <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++> has settled into a familiar rhythm: Bigby talks to people, makes choices, conducts investigations, and occasionally gets stabbed, pummeled, or shot. The gameâs design is well established, and episode three displays the best and the worst of what <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++> has to offer.Bigby and Snow spend most of âA Crooked Mileâ tracking the birdlike Ichabod Crane. We learn, for example, that he regularly and intentionally neglects and ignores his poorest constituents, giving us insight into both his character and those found at the Trip Trap. Maybe Holly, Grenn, and the Woodsman are sullen, violent, suspicious, and anti-authoritarian because theyâre constantly let down by an ineffectual and unsympathetic government.(Snow seems more compassionate, but even she comes down surprisingly hard on Aunty Greenleafâs cottage glamour industry, War on Drugs style.)Those downtrodden characters soften if Bigby is nice to them but only become rougher around the edges when heâs not. On the one hand, itâs great that Bigbyâs interactions and relationships are interesting, persistent, and reactive; on the other, <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++>â social, racial, and economic subtext is sometimes a mere reflecting pool. Wherever you-as-Bigby falls along these political fault lines, <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++> is too happy to spit out the attitudes youâve already put into it.Meanwhile, âMileââs structure is the most complex yet, giving Bigby a handful of diverging routes before shuttling him toward a climactic finish. Each new choice has a compound effect, and this episode does a good job of giving each player a somewhat personalized experience. For example, my choices led me to the ever-sinister Bluebeard and Fly Catcher, the Tweedlesâ dopey janitor, but I missed out on a great scene with Jack Horner.The flipside is not all possible routes through âA Crooked Mileâ are equally fun or informative. My last stop, for example, was at the Tweedleâs office, where I picked through one file cabinet before being herded to the next part of the game. Because I just happened to pick the right (or wrong) interaction point, I missed out on an entire roomâs worth of info, and the big reveal of the seriesâ shadowy villains fell flat as a result.<+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++>â fast pace and trigger-happy checkpointing system were an annoyance in the first two episodes, but in âA Crooked Mile,â they make the writing, plotting, and pacing feel sloppy. Telltale have built a cool world, a great noir mystery, and characters Iâve grown to like, but theyâre sometimes betrayed by a gameplay pipeline that feels restrictive and exacting.Still, âA Crooked Mileâ starts off incredibly strong, with a plot that moves forward and spends extra time on the series best characters. And while the climax is a bit uneven, it pulls enough weight that I immediately regretted my final decision. If nothing else, âA Crooked Mileâ is the densest and most intriguing episode to date, a fine midpoint before what is shaping up to be a tumultuous conclusion.
Episode 4 â In Sheepâs ClothingâIn Sheepâs Clothingâ is all about the recently (and somewhat awkwardly) revealed kingpin at the heart of Fabeltownâs underworld. Bigby explores the Crooked Manâs various criminal enterprises, but we donât learn much that we couldnât have guessedâitâs not a big stretch to guess that a vicious, murderous loan shark would also dabble in trafficking, prostitution, racketeering, and extortion.This episode may not hold too many surprises, but it doubles down on the seriesâ thematic core in a way that makes Bigbyâs inevitable tĂŞte-Ă -tĂŞte with the Crooked Man incredibly satisfying.The large-scale conflict between Fabletownâs government and the Crooked Manâs mafia plays out through the gameâs minor characters. Without a place in society, people like Jack Horner, (Tiny) Tim, and Aunty Greenleaf find a home in the Crooked Manâs abandoned church. Meanwhile, Fables like Colin and Toad remain skeptical and resentful of the government, even if they havenât resorted to crime yet.Meanwhile, Snowâs assertive, authoritarian streak that began in Aunty Greenleafâs apartment continues during a showdown with Colin. After being proverbially stuffed into a fridge in the first episode, itâs nice to see Snow come into her own and exert some agency, even if I donât necessarily care for her new hardline politics. Her change from a white outfit into dark grey isnât just a matter of fashion, either. (I do wish she hadnât accused me-as-Bigby of excessive violence, thoughâI havenât dismembered or killed anybody yet!)Later, Bigby asks the un-glamoured Toad why itâs âso hard to just follow the rules,â and the answer is that Bluebeard and Crane have rigged the game against him. âItâs getting hard to tell the difference between the Business Office and Fables like the Crooked Man,â Toad replies, cutting to the heart of the matter.Bigby, of course, is at the center of these rising tensions, and his moral authority as a dispenser of justice and keeper of the peace is slipping. This is especially clear at the end of the episode, when Tim points out that Bigby, in his role as Sheriff, is complicit in creating a situation in Fabletown that allowed a criminal like the Crooked Man to become so powerful in the first place.That makes for tense, terse writing as it is, but Telltaleâs games live and die by forcing players to make interesting decisions. Nothing in âA Sheepâs Clothingâ comes to a head, but itâs clear that Bigby will soon have to choose between Snow and Colin, between doing whatâs right and doing what he can, between enforcing the law and trying to make Fabletown a better place.In short, the writing in âIn Sheepâs Clothingâ serves the gameâs most interesting decisions, and <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++>â mechanics illuminate and inform this episodesâ themes and dynamics. Despite being a relatively straightforward episodeâthereâs one standard fight scene, one minor branching path, and lots of expositionâthe link between the writing, the mechanics, and Bigbyâs last decision make âIn Sheepâs Clothingâ the richest episode to date.Episode 5 â Cry WolfâCry Wolf,â <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++>â finale, has a problem: itâs an entire episode of denouement, tasked with wrapping up loose ends and answering outstanding questions, usually through exposition. The main mystery driving the seriesâwho brutally decapitated Faith and Lily?âwas solved in âA Crooked Mile,â three real-time months ago. Any new information, while interesting, is tied to action that takes place before the events of âFaith.âThat doesnât keep Vivian and Georgie Porgieâs final scene from being the strongest in the episode and one of the best in the series. In it, Georgie details the Crooked Manâs machinations and puts his life in sharp relief against Bigbyâs. In a series about decisions and their consequences, Georgieâs admission that he âhad no choiceâ hits home. Georgieâs foul-mouthed swan song encapsulates all of the tensions and conflicts <+++> The Wolf Among Us </+++> has tried to explore during its run and in the process allows a violent pimp and his exploitative madame to cut tragic, sympathetic figures. The newly liberated Nerissa, like Georgie before her, spends most of her last scene ruminating on the past before offering Bigby an ambiguous farewell. Ambiguity can be a useful storytelling technique, but here it only leads to thematic inconsistency and kludgy, awkward plotting. Nerissaâs revelation doesnât stand up to scrutiny, but itâs the one moment in âCry Wolfâ that surges forward instead of looking back. For fans of the series, the energy generated by a well-placed tease for an inevitable Season Two gives this episode a boost.Nestled between Georgieâs catharsis and Nerissaâs masterstroke is the Crooked Manâs ad hoc trial, which should have been the apex of the episode. Itâs not, mostly because the Crooked Man isnât interesting enough to support âCry Wolfââs biggest set piece on his own. His introduction as a primary antagonist comes too late, and his motives are bland and his decisions opaque as a result. Worse, heâs predictable.  His ideology and self-defense would have been easily forecast in any case, but they were also pre-empted, subtly and poignantly, by Tiny Tim at the end of âIn Sheepâs Clothingâ and Georgie Porgie in the previous scene. At some point, The Wolf Among Us shifted from gritty noir mystery to police procedural, and everyone already knows how Law & Order usually ends.
The courtroom scene had a secondary goal, too: to bring Fabletown regulars together to show Bigby how his actions have affected the town. My save file actually treats Bigby as if he elected to burn Auntie Greenleafâs Glamour Tree down (I didnât). This is a small bug, but it undermines the gameâs raison dâĂŞtreâa reactive, internally consistent world is one of the foundational elements of The Wolf Among Usâ narrative design.My own little Auntie Greenleaf glitch didnât change the way âCry Wolfâ ends, and, most likely, neither did any of Bigbyâs other decisions. Bigbyâs choices were never going to have a huge effect on Fabletownâthese games have limitsâbut itâs enough to have made them.
