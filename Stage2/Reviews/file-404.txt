I donât know about you guys, but my favorite puzzle games are the ones that make me feel like a genius. Itâs an extremely delicate balance to achieve, because if the puzzles are too easy, it can feel boring. If theyâre too hard, Iâm going to feel like an idiot. Somewhere in between those two ends of the spectrum is a sweet spot, and it can be especially tricky to pinpoint since every person is different. <+++> Super Sharp </+++> [$1.99] hits that sweet spot for me.<+++> Super Sharp </+++> by 1Button is an exceedingly clever little puzzle game that is incredibly easy to pick-up-and-play. Each level presents you with a couple of shapes and a little goal square. All you need to do is touch any part of a shape to the goal square that matches its color, and then the level will be complete and youâll move on to the next. It may sound simple, and at first it is. Mechanically, all you have to do is drag your finger across the screen to âsliceâ and then let gravity do the rest, similar to <+++> Icebreaker: A Viking Voyage </+++> [$0.99].Things quickly get complicated, though, as youâll soon be dealing with anti-gravity blocks, spinning contraptions, and colored shapes that must be matched to specific goal squares. Itâs actually incredibly impressive how different each level feels, especially since there are over a hundred to solve. For an even greater challenge, you can also try to get the âstarâ in each level by solving the puzzle in a limited number of moves.Actually, it can be pretty helpful to check how many moves it takes to star a level since that can often give an idea of what youâre supposed to do. For example, I was momentarily stuck on one puzzle that was basically one long rectangle with a ton of goal squares on either side. I first tried slicing little bits off of it and letting them fall, but it was nearly impossible to hit the goals with any accuracy. I checked the star number and it said it could be solved in just a few moves, and it suddenly hit me: make two diagonal slices down the middle to create a wedge that would split the shape into two pieces, each falling straight down on either side. Perfect!There were countless moments like that during my time with the game, where Iâd be trying something that didnât quite work and would have to stop and think outside the box a bit. Itâs a great feeling when it works out, and it really does make you feel a tiny bit smarter. Of course, there are also times when youâll just be slicing like a drunken fruit ninja until the gameâs physics finally have mercy on you and a small piece of a shape happens to hit the goal.Thatâs one of the few complaints I have with the game, actually. Some of the puzzles are designed in such a way that you have to be reallyÂ precise with your cutting and the timing of your cuts, sometimes several times in a row. It can be really frustrating when you keep restarting a level not because you donât know what to do, but because you do know what to do but just canât get the timing down. My other beef is that the âtouch the top right corner to restart the levelâ function doesnât seem to be terribly reliable, and it can make the former complaint even more maddening.
Overall, though, those things are pretty minor. <+++> Super Sharp </+++> is a superb puzzler that really nails the difficulty curve, gently introducing new ideas and getting you to think in different ways over and over. It can be a tiny bit frustrating later on, but the vast majority of the levels are perfectly solvable if you just stop and think a bit. What more could you want from a puzzle game?
