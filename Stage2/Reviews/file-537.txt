I sat down to play <+++> Crobble </+++> [Free] this afternoon. An hour passed, and then my battery started dropping... first 20%, then all the way lower than 10%. It wasnât until I was completely in the red before I figured it was time to put it down and start writing rather than playing. Iâm pretty sure if I hadnât had less than half a battery when Iâd started, Iâd still be hooked to it.A game that blends the best aspects of <+++> Scrabble </+++>, and <+++> Tetris </+++>, youâll lose yourself for countless hours as it continuously challenges both your vocabulary and reaction speeds at once. One of the most engaging and entertaining word-based puzzlers I've played this year, <+++> Crobble </+++> is timeless, intelligent, fiendishly good fun, and even better still, thereâs no hidden in-app purchases once you unlock the full shebang.Once unlocked, the game presents you three modes of play; Arcade mode, Blitz, and Zen. Varying greatly in difficulty and toughness, all three modes are easily just as accessible as each other, with both additional modes offering new fresh twists on gameplay. Arcade mode, by far my favorite, is a 100 level challenge that becomes exceedingly difficult as you progress. In Blitz mode, everything youâve discovered and unlocked in Arcade mode comes into play in a frantic quick fire approach, which further challenges your reaction speeds as you advance. Catering for all, Zen mode is a laid-back, chilled-out, casual mode minus all the bells and whistles. In all three modes, your goal is to tap on the letters to form words of three letters or more. When the word is submitted, the selected tiles disappear, creating further space for falling letters and earning precious points towards your level multiplier. At certain intervals, bomb tiles will descend, which allow you to explode the surrounding letters and renew your options. Bonus points can be accrued via the length multiplier and the modifier multiplier, which are earned by creating words four letters or more and incorporating a ânumbered letter.âWhen the tiles stack up to the top of the screen, itâs game over, but with no more than a quick tap youâll be off and away again in no time. Should you fail, this game will only punish you by coercing you to carry on playing. Issues with <+++> Crobble? </+++> Zero so far. My only suggestion would perhaps be to have an accessible list of the value or definition of each tile, as the quick-fire instructions that flashed upon my screen were something I too easily disregarded by accident. However, such a minor niggle is enough to be scoffed at, and youâll probably be having far too much fun attempting to surpass your friends highest scores thanks to its handy social integration feature.The game that should come with a warning label attached, <+++> Crobble </+++> takes a beautifully simple concept and mixes it up with some fantastic gameplay modes in order to provide players with one of the most enjoyably captivating games this summer.My longest word is âintuitiveâ at 9 letters long. Whatâs yours?
