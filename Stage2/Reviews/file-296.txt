Area/Code's <+++> Drop7 </+++> [App Store] number puzzler has drawn positive reviews from our forum members and a Game of the Month nod from IGN. The iPhone game is a version of a popular Flash game called Chain Factor that can be played in your browser.  The game involves dropping numbered discs into a row/column.
