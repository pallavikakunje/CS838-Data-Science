Blake Pattersonâs review of the original <+++> Train Conductor </+++> [$2.99] on Touch Arcade remarked that it was âlike <+++> Flight Control </+++> [R.I.P.] on railsâ. Thatâs certainly the feeling I got from playing the latest game in the series as well. <+++> Train Conductor World </+++> [Free] truly feels like a blast from the past with its central mechanic of routing things around the screen with swipes, as I probably had at least five or six games on my phone back in the day that were heavily inspired by Firemintâs classic airplane game. I canât remember the last time I played something like that, and itâs a heck of a lot of fun revisiting similar ideas in <+++> World </+++>. Of course, this is no longer 2009, and the App Store is a very different place now. Can The Voxel Agentsâ cute little trains keep up?The first time you play the game, you may be forgiven for thinking itâs a bit too easy. After all, the trains move slowly and you can even stop them with a tap if things get a out of hand. Eventually, though, things ramp up quite a bit. If you pass a level âperfectlyâ (more on that in a second) youâll unlock a harder difficulty where everything moves faster, and the game gets shockingly challenging once youâve sunk a few hours into it.The tile system is definitely there to gently pressure you into spending money, but itâs not bad. Iâve already unlocked eight locations without spending a dime, and Iâm having a grand olâ time playing through them over and over. There are also ads in the game, including opt-in videos to continue a level once youâve crashed, but they donât get in the way too much and you can get rid of them with a very reasonable $1.99 purchase. The only other IAP in the game is to buy new trains, but these are basically just skins and can easily be ignored if you just want to play for free.
I really canât say enough good things about <+++> Train Conductor World </+++>. If you were around in the early days of the App Store, the gameâs touchscreen chaos management will surely fill you with at least some nostalgia, and itâs all wrapped up in an incredibly good looking and fair free-to-play package for newcomers. Sure, itâd be nice if the âiron tileâ mechanics werenât there to slow your progress down, but the tile system as a whole is such a genius idea that I can forgive the slight freemium squeeze that comes along with it. If youâre looking for a game thatâs fun, challenging, and costs absolutely nothing, then this is the train youâre gonna wanna catch.
