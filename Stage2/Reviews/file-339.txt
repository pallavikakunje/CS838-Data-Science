It's hard to recall what the first flight simulator game I played was. I believe it was <+++> Wing Commander </+++> on the PC, before I graduated on to other space games like theÂ <+++> X-Wing </+++> and <+++> TIE FighterÂ  </+++>series, as well asÂ <+++> Descent </+++>. Either way, it was love at first sight. The cold loneliness of space translated perfectly to the video game realm, and the possibilities were endless since the theme wasn't tethered to any particular planet or rules.Any given day my adventures could take me to another uncharted region I've never seen before, either teeming with life or completely silent. And that really is the magic of sci-fi -- you can never truly be prepared for what it might throw at you next.Â <+++> Hyperburner </+++> [$2.99] doesn't really break any conventions that have been present for the past 20 years or so, but it's one heck of a ride.And so does the control scheme, which provides a heap of different options to choose from. You can go with the traditional third-person view, or first-person cockpit, both of which change up your fundamental approach to the game. But what I really dig is the power to fine-tune the sensitivity of your ship (which can be adjusted to the tee)Â and test it right there on the options menu. It's a really cool feature, as is the instant pause mechanic when you lift your finger off the screen. It's saved me many a time when I looked up at something else.Each zone has its own signature art style, complete with unique hazards to face. Said objects might be moving or static, but either way it's going to take some skill to navigate around them. The patterns are wonderfully crafted, almost puzzle-like -- so there's no feeling of cheap deaths or haphazard design flaws. Every death is your fault, and betters you in some manner. There's only several worldsÂ but each one looks entirely different, almost like a different game in a way. They throw a lot of very tight "thread the needle" type of situations at players constantly, forcing people to learn from their mistakes as they hit that replay button over and over. It's addicting and beautiful at the same time.Beyond that, there isn't a whole lot to do if you aren't keen on revisiting existing content. There's more ships to unlock, most of which feel the same. Sure there's no premium purchases, energy, or power-up for money mechanics, but you can probably breeze through it in one long day session. It's worth it, mind, but there could easily be something more -- even the endless modes don't feel as fulfilling as the objectives.As long as you're okay with a well-paced adventure that doesn't let up from start to finish, you won't be disappointed with <+++> Hyperburner </+++>. It might not deliver as much extra junk as you're used to for a premium game, but it's engaging from minute one.
