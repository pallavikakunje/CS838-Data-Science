Most people that have seen the new <+++> Star Wars </+++> movie enjoyed it, but one complaint Iâve seen a lot is that it borrows heavily from the first film, <+++> A New Hope </+++>. Iâve read that it was intentional, and part of the reason was probably to remind people of how much they loved the original trilogy and help them forget the prequels. And as weird as it may seem, it sort of reminds me of what Red Winter has done with the latest <+++> Dungelot </+++> sequel, <+++> Dungelot: Shattered Lands </+++> [$3.99].If you never played the first game (or the sequel), the basic idea behind the series is a what if: what if <+++> Minesweeper </+++> was actually a dungeon crawler? Itâs a pretty good way to describe the game, but if youâre a <+++> Minesweeper </+++> fan the comparison is actually a bit superficial. Each level (or floor) presents you with a board of tiles that must be uncovered in order for you to move on. Thereâs almost no way to figure out whatâs hidden under each one, so at first you just tap in whatever direction you want. Sometimes youâll uncover enemies, but they donât immediately end the game like a mine would. Instead you need to either ignore or defeat them, depending on whether or not they are standing in the way of more tiles. Ultimately, your goal is to uncover a golden key which is your ticket deeper into the dungeons.There are a few new things added to the series this time around, like new characters and weapons, brand new mini games that randomly show up between floors, and a mansion where you can buy permanent boosts (like a giant plant that has a 15% chance of eating monsters on each floor). It still feels a heck of a lot like the original <+++> Dungelot </+++>, though, and thatâs definitely not a complaint. We here at Touch Arcade Towers usually try to avoid over-used words like âaddictiveâ when describing games, but itâs actually a great way to describe the series. The basic gameplay loop of exploring and fighting monsters, dying, using your coins to buy better stuff, and then getting even further next time is tuned to near-perfection and just ridiculous amounts of fun.
I can imagine some people complaining that the game is too similar to the first <+++> Dungelot </+++>, but I see that as a good thing. Like <+++> The Force Awakens </+++>, it tries to bring back everything you loved about the original, while still adding a few things here and there to spice up the formula a bit. In some ways <+++> Shattered Lands </+++>Â feels less like a sequel and more like a fulfillment of the promise behind the first game, like this is whatÂ Red Winter wanted to make all along. (Maybe thatâs why they dropped the â3â?) If you liked the first two games or even if you hated the second (which, admittedly, was greatly improved on its re-release), then you owe it to yourself to try this third installment. Welcome back, <+++> Dungelot </+++>.
