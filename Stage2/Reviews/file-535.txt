<+++> Tetris </+++> [$1.99] is one awesome game. I personally consider it one of the best games ever made, and certainly one of the closest to pure perfection. While most other games are work-in-progress designs that eventually have to be snipped off, polished up, and released, <+++> Tetris </+++>'s big coming-out releases on Game Boy and NES were essentially flawless realizations of the design's potential. Other than catching up with technology like internet play, what do you really add to <+++> Tetris </+++> to make it better? Every attempt to change the game in some way has resulted in, at best, a lateral move, and at worst, an absolute disaster. Well, <+++> 99 Bricks: Wizard Academy </+++> [Free] offers a few interesting answers to my question, and while it's probably not a better game, it's a more than worthy side-trip for fans of that classic.The goal of 99 Bricks is to build yourself a wizard tower out of falling bricks, all of which are in the shapes of the familiar <+++> Tetris </+++> blocks. You need to get your tower as high as you can to show what a cool wizard you are. Each of the game's stages starts you off with a different shape for the base, and it's up to you to build it up from there. Along the way, rival wizards who are jealous of your tower will pop in to throw some complications in, but generally, your worst enemies are going to be gravity and your own mistakes. If you you lose too many blocks off the sides of your tower, the game will spawn a tower top, finishing off your current run. The camera will zoom out to let you have a look at your completed tower, and you'll be given some coins to spend in the game's shop. It might seem like <+++> 99 Bricks </+++> is a fairly straightforward variation, but what's interesting about it is how it uses the near-ubiquity of its inspirationÂ to mess with your expectations.The most critical difference is that your blocks don't lock into place when you set them down. If they're top-heavy and there's nothing to secure them from tumbling down, they will. If you place them on top of another block with the heavy part hanging off the side, they'll slide down and create a usually-fatal angled area. Even if you're a good little <+++> Tetris </+++> player and diligently hook the blocks into each other as you build, you'll notice parts of your tower starting to lean a bit at times. Fortunately, at certain height intervals, your tower will lock into place, but any leans or oddly-placed pieces will also be frozen in place. You can't just single-mindedly put the pieces together. You have to think about things like balance and weight to ensure pieces you've already placed don't end up taking the whole tower down.There are several different stages to play, with each new one unlocking a new magic spell and a new rival wizard. To unlock the next stage, you have to complete a variety of missions in the stage you're on. The missions are typical goals you'd find in a endless game, and they point strongly to the game's origins as a free-to-play title. <+++> 99 Bricks </+++> was originally released as a free game in a couple of regions, with IAPs and an economy that reflected that status. The developers ended up deciding on a paid model for its wide release, reworking everything to cut the grind and focus on fun. As such, things like upgrades, new wands, and hats are all priced affordably enough to earn pretty frequently by simply playing the game. There's no longer a stitch of IAP to be found in the game.If there's one thing that doesn't work well with this game, it's the same thing that hurts the iOS version of <+++> Tetris </+++>: the controls. They're pretty close to how that game plays, with swipes to the left and right moving your piece, swiping down quick-dropping it, and tapping on the screen rotating it. It's probably the best possible layout without a proper directional pad and buttons, but I've always felt it was a bit too slippery in <+++> Tetris </+++> when the game speeds up, and the half-block movement in <+++> 99 Bricks </+++> adds to the problem. Accidental rotations sometimes happen when you're tapping on a blue magic orb to collect it, and of course, like <+++> Tetris </+++>, sometimes you mean to swipe and the game reads it as a tap. A misplaced block can be devastating, so it stings when it happens due to a control goof-up.
Even with the occasional control-related frustration, I still think <+++> 99 Bricks: Wizard Academy </+++> is a terrific little game. As a fan of <+++> Tetris </+++>, its familiarity is inviting, and the ways it betrays that familiarity are exciting and sometimes hilarious. Most of all, this is just a really fun falling block puzzle game, enjoyable both as an endless game and as a more goal-focused progression experience. I think it's something anyone who likes <+++> Tetris </+++> can appreciate, and that's just about everyone there is, right?
