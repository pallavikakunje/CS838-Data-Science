I remember hearing that people were so obsessed with <+++> Tetris </+++> in the 80âs that when theyâd close their eyes theyâd still see the pieces falling and fitting together in their mind. Itâs called the Tetris Effect, and Iâve always thought it was weird that people considered it strange enough to warrant its own name. Pretty much anything I get super into will start to invade my thoughts and dreams when I close my eyes. Isnât that pretty normal? Why is <+++> Tetris </+++> special? Certainly there are plenty of iOS games that give me the same âeffectâ when I play them long enough. Like <+++> Swapperoo </+++> [$0.99], for instance.<+++> Swapperoo </+++> is a new game that has definitely been giving me what Iâd call a âMatch Threeâ effect, in that I have a weirdly strong urge to shift imaginary shapes around and clear matches even when Iâm not playing the game. Of course, this probably wouldnât be happening if the game was terrible, and indeed itâs not. In fact, itâs easily one of the best and most inventive puzzle games Iâve played in quite some time.For example, you donât swipe tiles to make matches like in <+++> Candy Crush </+++>. You donât slide rows like in <+++> You Must Build A Boat </+++> [$2.99]. You donât drag pieces around like in <+++> Puzzle & Dragons </+++> [Free]. In <+++> Swapperoo </+++>, each tile has a certain shape that can only move in certain ways. Tapping an arrow piece, for example, shifts that piece in whatever direction itâs facing. Tapping a circle will pop it like a bubble, causing the pieces above to fall down one space. Squares canât be moved at all (by you, anyway). Those are the basics, but there are variations on each shape as well. There are drill arrows that destroy--rather than swap with--the piece they face, and certain squares are completely fixed in place and canât be moved at all. There are grey pieces that wonât match with anything, spiral portals, and several other pieces that behave in unique ways.On top of all that, there are also special âeyeâ tiles that have further unique properties. Skull Eyes, for example, will blow up and end the game if you donât clear them within a certain number of moves. Star Eye tiles are usually part of an objective and a certain number of them need to be cleared to pass a level. Finally, Heart Eye tiles must be protected at all costs and Big Eye tiles will hunt them down and end your game if too many are destroyed. Actually, there are even more pieces than all those, like padlock pieces that need to be âunlockedâ before they can be cleared, but Iâll stop there. You get the idea.Setting gameplay aside, the rest of the package is pretty outstanding as well. The visuals remind me of a lighter <+++> Puzzlejuice </+++> [$1.99], with a flat, squared look that conveys everything in a simple and sleek way with no fuss. The music and sound effects also do a great job of setting the mood without distracting from the brilliant puzzling. There also seems to be a hint of a story weaved between some levels, with mysterious text appearing every so often.The game has two main modes, Regular (Iâm calling it that) and Challenge. Regular is split into normal difficulty and hard difficulty, and Challenge spans three pages of levels and is even more puzzle-y than the regular mode. There youâll be given a few pieces that need to be cleared in a limited number of moves, and most of the levels seem to require a very specific solution to solve them. Itâs a clever way to build on the core mechanics of the game, and I can see some people having even more fun there.
Most of us are pretty sick of match three games at this point, and itâs safe to say it takes something pretty special to squeeze a glowing review out of the genre these days. <+++> Swapperoo </+++> by Fallen Tree Games is one such game. Itâs incredibly clever, deeply strategic, has an inviting visual style that begs to be interacted with, and is just plain fun. If youâre one of the people I often see in our forums asking for âpremiumâ match three games with no free-to-play shenanigans, welcome to your next addiction.
