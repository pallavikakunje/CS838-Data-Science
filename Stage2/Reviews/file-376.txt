First off, sorry about that headline. I tried to fight the urge and I failed. Second, if youâre bummed that thereâs no <+++> Super Mario </+++> game on the App Store (yet?), then you should drop what youâre doing and grab Veewoâs <+++> Super Phantom Cat </+++> [$1.99] right meow. Itâs a fairly traditional platformer under the surface, borrowing heavily from Nintendoâs resident plumber, but I have to say--that surface is flippinâ gorgeous.That place, apparently, is called Phantom World. You play as a cat named Chemist White who wants to become a superhero (rather than breaking bad and becoming a drug kingpin, I guess). He meets a spiky-haired guy named Flash Eyes who promises to show him how to become a phantom, which I guess will help. Itâs kind of hard to follow the story through the slightly broken translations in the cutscenes, but luckily itâs not that important. All you need to know is that your most basic goal is to find the portal at the end of each level until you run out of them and finish the game. (And more levels are âcoming soonâ, of course.)Another important aspect of the game is the addition of power-ups (or âspritesâ). Pretty much every level is built around a specific ability, which youâll usually find close to the starting point. The first one youâll come across is a Bullet Sprite that allows you to shoot in the direction youâre facing. Later youâll find other sprites (which bob along behind you like an adorable little balloon) like a ground pound that can drill through bricks, a teleporter, and even a bomb. (Iâm glad real cats donât have bombs.)Helping you through each stage are the near-perfect controls, with a pretty standard layout of direction arrows on the left and action buttons on the right. I say ânearâ perfect because the game lets you shift the buttons around the screen to your liking, but unfortunately you canât separate the two arrows from each other (since I usually prefer a slightly diagonal orientation), and there are only two sizes for the buttons. They can all be big or small, and thatâs it. Of course, really thatâs just nitpicking as itâs perfectly possible to find a comfortable layout with whatâs on offer. (Itâs worth noting that thereâs another control scheme as well that focuses more on dragging your finger to run and jump, but I found the regular method far more reliable.)
With its sharp and colorful visuals and classic gameplay sensibilities, <+++> Super Phantom Cat </+++> is a pretty perfect hybrid of the new and old. That doesnât mean the game itself is perfect, though, as there were moments when I wished the developers had been as creative with the platforming genre as theyâd been with the art. (<+++> Wondercat Adventures </+++> [$2.99] comes to mind as a good example of a cat-themed platformer that thinks outside the box a bit more.) Still, the level designs are brilliant and the unlockable characters are a nice carrot on a stick to keep you playing. Most important, the game is a ton of fun and feels great to play. So what if itâs not that original? You love Mario and you love cats. Whatâs the problem?
