I've been on the same map in <+++> Fieldrunners 2 </+++> [$2.99] for half the day and it's driving me up the wall.  Like a textual Yoda, the in-game help keeps telling me the same thing, âUse the choke points.â I do but keep failing. When I attempt to save up for lasers, I find myself getting overrun. When I trust in bargain-bin Gatling guns, I find myself getting exactly what I paid for.  The happy medium exists somewhere. I know it. I just need to figure out how to get it.There is no delicate way to put it.

It's a tower defense game and a bloody good one at that.The controls are what you would expect of many tower defense games.

If you want to do anything else, such as upgrade one of your many death-dealing facilities or make use of one of the game's many power-ups, you simply need to tap it.While the control scheme is simple enough, the gameplay is something else entirely. I'm going to risk sounding inappropriately cheesy and tell you that there's something for everyone in <+++> Fieldrunners 2 </+++>.

The graphics are crisp, clear and outfitted with a lavish attention to detail â you even get little bluebirds fluttering across the world map. The music is great as well. However, morbid as this might sound, what I really like are the sounds that the little clone-soldiers make whenever they're turned into a charred, smoldering patch on the ground.What really makes <+++> Fieldrunners 2 </+++> work, however, is not the souped-up aesthetics or the bigger roster of towers. No, sir. It's the little things that make <+++> Fieldrunners 2 </+++> shine so bright. Here, unlike in its predecessor, the enemies are just a tad bit smarter. They know how to space out.
