In our recent review of <+++> Super Phantom Cat </+++> [$1.99] I remarked that I âwished the developers had been as creative with the platforming genre as theyâd been with the artâ. I loved the game in large part because of its wonderful presentation, and the solid gameplay was definitely fun despite feeling a bit too safe at the end of the day. And now, immediately after, I have Kenny Sun's <+++> Circa Infinity </+++> [$2.99] in my hands. Itâs striking in that I like the game just as much as <+++> Phantom Cat </+++>, but my reasons for it are exactly the opposite. The gameplay in <+++> Infinity </+++> is unlike anything Iâve played before, to the point where Iâm not even sure you could call it a âplatformerâ at all. The gameâs presentation, however, is pretty solid but nowhere near as eye-catchingly beautiful as <+++> Phantom Cat </+++>. None of that should be taken as complaining, though, because Iâm sure there are plenty of people who are completely over the moon for the traditional gameplay of the former and absolutely in love the sparse pixel stylings are of the latter.Where <+++> Circa Infinity </+++> differs is the fact that the game is not just one circle, and the other circles are not spread out in space for you to travel to and from. No, each concurrent circle is inside the last, sort of like the rings of a tree. But each ring is actually sort of like a pizza, because thereâs a triangular slice on each one that acts as a portal to the inside when you hit the jump button over it. Circles, triangles, trees, pizzasâŚ confused? Once you see a video or picture (or even better, play it for yourself) it quickly makes sense and the mechanics become crystal clear.Luckily, when you die you donât have to completely start over. Continuing the theme of the game having a surplus of clever ideas I havenât seen much of before, each time you get hit you simply teleport back to the previous circle for you to try again. It may not seem like much of a punishment at first, but eventually the levels get so crazy that youâll almost immediately get hit again on every circle you move back to--unless youâre ready for them. Mercifully, the game also inserts circles with no enemies (or very few) every so often so you donât death spiral all the way back to the beginning of the level.
<+++> Circa Infinity </+++> is a game that may not look like much in the screenshots, but if you like twitch-y arcade games and outside-the-box platformers I can basically guarantee youâll fall in love with this. Plus, once itâs in motion thereâs a weird kind of ugly beauty to the aesthetic, like a nightmare version of <+++> Downwell </+++> [$2.99]. Be warned, though: it gets insanely hard. Like âpatting your head/rubbing your bellyâ hard. If any of that sounds even remotely interesting to you, do yourself a solid and hit that buyÂ button pronto.
