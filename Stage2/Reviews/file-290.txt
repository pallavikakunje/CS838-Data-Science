Tiger Style's first entry into the iPhone market kicks off with this very interesting game description:You are a spider. One afternoon, you discover an abandoned mansion. Where is the family who lived here? What happened, and why did they leave? Search for clues as you adventure from room to room on the hunt for your next meal.And the game is as unique as it sounds.  <+++> Spider: The Secret of Bryce Manor </+++> is a beautifully created action (adventure?) game that places you in the role of a spider who must spin webs in order capture enough food to make it to the next level.  Use up too much silk between meals and you won't survive. As a spider, you are able to crawl across objects, jump great lengths and lay down silk to weave your web.  Spinning a web simply requires you to create closed geometric shapes using your silk.   Tapping on the spider toggles silk production while swiping on the spider causes it to jump.  Finally, crawling is invoked by simply tapping on the screen.  All in all, the controls work incredibly well and makes it feel like a natural iPhone game.The game comes with 28 beautifully hand drawn levels that walk you through Bryce Manor.  Secret areas can be discovered and an underlying mystery ties the game together.   The storyline, however, is simply a bonus to an immersive puzzle/action game, and I'll admit I haven't myself discovered the secret of Bryce Manor.  The gameplay, itself, will keep you occupied as you strategically manage your silk to capture your next meals.   Different bugs require different strategies to capture and the 28 levels in story mode should keep you occupied for some time.    Beyond Story mode, there are 3 additional modes: Feeding Frenzy (race against time), Precision (less Silk to work with), and Hunger Mode (Keep eating or die). Here's our gameplay video:
