Several times in my life Iâve fantasized about packing up my guitar and some recording equipment and moving to a remote cabin for a month or so to write and record music. Far removed from the stress, distraction, and responsibility of normal life, Iâd be free to put all my energy into crafting the next <+++> Sgt. Pepperâs </+++> or <+++> Pet Sounds </+++>. (Itâs a fantasy, after all.) Unfortunately, doing such a thing is a luxury most people canât afford for a number of reasons, which means Iâll have to settle for squeezing my recording sessions into spare hours in the garage like normal.Apparently game developers have similar fantasies, because last year there was a game accelerator program that took place over two months in a remote cabin in Stockholm. Aspiring developers from all over the world met there and were given the time and resources to create the game of their dreams, with coaching from industry professionals. It was called Stugan (Swedish for âcabinâ), and the very first complete game to come out of the experiment is _PRISM [$2.99] by Clint Siu. Itâs a sleek little puzzler that tasks you with solving various abstract puzzles while manipulating shapes in 3D space. It certainly sounds interesting, but is it <+++> Pet Sounds </+++>?Well, probably not. But itâs definitely brilliant, unique, and very beautiful. When you fire up the game youâll be thrust into a weird little solar system of shapes, and your goal is to poke and prod them until they reveal their luminous cores, at which point you move on to the next âplanetâ and do the same thing again. The whole experience feels wonderfully alien as thereâs no text and very, very little instruction explaining what youâre supposed to do. For that reason, I should probably warn you that the rest of this review could potentially ruin the fun of discovering the gameâs various mechanics for yourself.The first thought I had when I saw the puzzles was âOh, this is kinda like <+++> The Witness </+++>.â Later, when Iâd played for a bit, I thought âOh, this is kinda like <+++> The Room </+++> [$0.99 (HD)].â Now, I havenât actually played much of either of those games, so take those comparisons with a grain of salt. However, Iâve seen people say similar things in our forums so I donât think Iâm that far off. As I said earlier, the game isnât that difficult from beginning to end, but if you like (or are intrigued by) symbol puzzles and manipulating objects without much instruction, youâll probably have a pretty good time throughout _PRISM.
Whether or not you fall in love with _PRISM ultimately depends on what you look for in videogames. Do you enjoy âexperiencesâ that transport you to another place even if what youâre doing there isnât particularly challenging or long-lasting? Or do you prefer your games to be tough-as-nails and stressful, putting your brain and/or fingers through a gruelling workout? Like most people, I think I fall somewhere between those extremes. _PRISM is definitely more toward the first category, but I still found it absolutely delightful from beginning to end. If this is what we can expect from the projects coming out of Stugan, I canât wait to see whatâs next.
