We here at Touch Arcade donât usually review the many, many free little arcade games that pop up on the App Store each week. Thereâs no rule against it, of course, but the fact is there are just too many games, and our time is usually better spent focusing on (slightly) meatier experiences. For example, just last week saw the release of <+++> Slingshot Rush </+++> [Free], which is yet another fairly shallow little Boombit game like the many others that came before. I actually found it incredibly fun and satisfying to play, but itâs ultimately too simple to fully review. I mean, you hold the screen to swing around corners and itâs really fun. I donât even think a gimmicky question-and-answer format could stretch that out enough to count as an actual review.Guys and gals, Iâm completely smitten with this game. Thereâs nothing quite like executing a perfect drift through a tight turn in a racing videogame, and <+++> Thumb Drift </+++> exclusively focuses on that one feeling. I instantly understood what they were going for when I saw the gameâs trailer a few weeks back, and Iâm thrilled to say they completely pulled it off.Drifting in a Real Gameâ˘ (you know, on a console or PC) is satisfying enough with a controller, but I think it might feel even better here on the touchscreen. All you do is slide your finger back and forth behind your vehicle to sort of push it side to side, kind of like <+++> Smash Cops </+++> [$4.99] and its follow-up <+++> Bandits </+++> [Free]. It feels like a simpler, more tactile way to steer a car and I wish more racing games on iOS adopted a similar method of control. It may not be quite as precise as a D-pad (or even tilting), but itâs incredibly fun and feels very natural. Especially when all youâre doing is sliding around.Of course, it looks pretty darn great on a small screen as well. The App Store description amusingly describes the visuals as âcutting edge, flat shaded, low poly graphicsâ, which is accurate, more or less. In practice, it reminds me of <+++> Landsliders </+++> [Free] mixed with <+++> Turbo Dismount </+++> [Free], so if youâve played both of those games (and you absolutely should play both of those games) then you know what to expect. <+++> Dismount </+++>, in particular, is apt since when you crash in <+++> Thumb Drift </+++> your vehicle will explode and pieces of it (including the driver) fly off in all directions, seeming to loosely follow some kind of cartoon physics. Itâs a fun little addition, but I do wish the gameâs replays were longer and you could watch all of it in slo-mo like the aforementioned game as well.
In fact, the replays being a bit on the short side is basically my only complaint with this game right now. And thatâs such a minor thing that it barely even counts as a âcomplaintâ at all. In truth, from where Iâm sitting <+++> Thumb Drift </+++> is nearly perfect as far as fun little highscore chasers are concerned, and the central mechanic is just ridiculously fun and feels like butter. Thereâs also a light mission system and tons of cars to collect to keep you going, but even if those things werenât there, Iâd still be playing every single day. Plus, the game is free (with occasional ads that you can disable with a purchase), so you basically have no excuse to not at least give it a try to see if it clicks with you. Please do, and then tell your friends, because I want this updated forever.
