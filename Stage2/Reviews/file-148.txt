It has become clichĂŠ to call Camouflajâs Kickstarter-baby <+++> Republique </+++> [$1.99] ambitious, but that doesnât mean itâs not true. This undeniably is the most ambitious iOS game Iâve ever played, showing off AAA production value at every turn. And more surprising, thatâs not entirely the reason I LOVE <+++> Republique </+++>, instead finding the little-touches this gameâs most endearing quality.âExordiumâ, the first of 5 chapters- to this episodic stealth-action thriller, does not disappoint. It starts with a female protagonist named Hope, who is held captive within an oppressive totalitarian compound, in the age of the internets and government surveillance. And then there are you: the player acting hacker, who is desperately called upon by Hope to help her escape the captors. The story slowly begins to unfold from there â for lack of spoilers â and does so wonderfully, and mainly through means of gameplay. Know this: <+++> Republique </+++>âs cast of excellently acted and all-star voiced characters are likable, in their own way â one of my favorite being the hilarious text-to-speech Cooper.
Yes, I said âtext-to-speech!âWho, what, when, and why are revealed through exploring this beautifully rendered compound, across emails, voice-mail, notes, tapes, you name it. These are a delightful reward to gain from simply sneaking around these intriguing walls. Most of <+++> Republique </+++>âs notes are to be taken serious, but there are also literal laugh-out-loud moments to be had, which is nice. I continued to explore because I cared to know more about this world Camouflaj has clearly taken so much time to flesh-out. I was not disappointed that I did, and found discovering plot-points to be much more engaging than having it spoon fed.<+++> Republique </+++> plays entirely one-touch â aside from a pinch-to-zoom function â and does so gracefully, as a stealth game. Much of its gameplay consists of directing Hope by tapping on location, while also tap-hacking your way from camera to camera, using OMNI-view, to see whatâs around the bend. Â I never felt like I needed a controller, nor wanted one. Republique controls beautifully as a touch game, and makes more sense, as so, when in regards to its narrative.The gameâs hack, hide, and run, as stealth-action games are expected. As you progress through the chapter, upgraded Â OMNI-hacks become available - allowing for more strategic options to evading or nullifying patrolling enemies. While on the subject of enemies, I should note that <+++> Republique </+++>âs keeps with tradition and mostly follow a looped patrol-path. Donât expect dynamic AI all around, but rather AI that does a damn fine job of chasing you down if you are spotted. Regardless, the games stealth-scenarios are always fun to overcome, thanks to the games interesting control mechanics and keen design.<+++> Republique </+++> ran me 5 hours, finishing with a 68% completion ranking and a Play+ option to go back and gather what I missed. I instantly went back to start gathering. The best one-thing this game does is collectables, allowing all â of which there are plenty â of them to have purpose, personality, and heart.For example: Hope can pickpocket patrolling enemies to take back Cooperâs stolen games, which is one of many collectables <+++> Republique </+++> has to offer. The cool-thing about this collectable isâŚ theyâre actually other great iOS games dressed as Atari carts. For collecting these, you get to hear Cooper explain why you should buy these OTHER iOS games, in the most charming of ways. Bravo, Camouflaj, thatâs the nicest thing Iâve ever seen a game do for others and really expresses the personalities behind the game; and you can never have enough personality in any game.Technically, the game played smoothly on my iPad 2 and iPhone 4S, with the exceptional âchugâ for saving or loading. As usual, I found the tablet provides a better experience due to screen real-estate, but itâs totally playable on the smaller. Otherwise, a single crash back to the OS is all I have for technical gripes.In fact, I didnât find much to complain about while playing thru âExordiumâ. At one point I desired a mini-map â which <+++> Republique </+++> does not have â only to later realize that I never *really* needed it and found its absence to drive exploration. I guess if I had one complaint it is <+++> Republique </+++>âs lack of an objective list, maybe? I didnât really need one, but others may? The fact that Iâm not complaining about eye-poking IAPs is precedent enough.<+++> Republique </+++> is risky. Itâs a big budget stealth-action epic on iOS that is attempting to change the face of touch games forever. And it shouldâŚ <+++> Republique </+++> is shaping up to be a masterpiece. Sure, there are more chapters to come, but based on what Iâve seen so farâŚ faith is running high. For those of you whoâve complained about the state of âcoreâ or âconsole-likeâ experiences on iOS â outside of ported games â you shouldnât hesitate to throw your moneys at Camouflaj. They deserve it. Exciting, fun, polished, and perfectly fit for the platform, <+++> Republique </+++> is showing me nothing but promise. Promise Iâm already convinced theyâre going to keep.You wanted a âreal game?â WellâŚ here it is.
