What separates the great games from the good games? <---> There </---> an intangible aspect of making a game feel fun to play that can be difficult to pin down when trying to describe it and even more difficult for a developer to create. But when a developer nails it down it truly sublime. <+++> Crossy Road </+++> [Free] absolutely nails how a game should feel which makes it endlessly replayable and my current go-to pick-up-and-play game. <---> The </---> game is essentially a randomly-generated take on <+++> Frogger </+++> where players initially control a chicken trying to cross highways and rivers to get as far as possible because the world is endlessly scrolling behind them and an eagle will come and swoop them up which is a good enough reason to get in gear. Someday the eagle will come for us all or we'll get hit by a train or swept into rapids. <---> Such </---> is the course of the universe. Really the game is just the same core concept as <+++> Frogger </+++> and on the surface it might be difficult to think how this is so special. <---> It </---> comes down to structure and feel of the game. As the title similarity to <+++> Flappy Bird </+++> may have tipped there a bit of an influence there. <---> The </---> scoring is simply about how far you get and you have only one life rather than multiple. I think these changes make the game rather accessible and built for quick sessions. <+++> Crossy Road </+++> utterly nails how a game should feel. <---> Tapping </---> to move forward has a great feel to it with just a bit of whimsy to it with the bouncing. When you get hit by a train you really feel the impact. <---> There </---> so many subtle details added to make the game .
