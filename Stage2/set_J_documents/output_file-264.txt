I've been on the same map in <+++> Fieldrunners 2 </+++> [$2. 99] for half the day and it driving me up the wall. Like a textual <---> Yoda </---> the in-game help keeps telling me the same thing âUse the choke points. â I do but keep failing. When I attempt to save up for lasers I find myself getting overrun. When I trust in bargain-bin <---> Gatling </---> guns I find myself getting exactly what I paid for. The happy medium exists somewhere. I know it. I just need to figure out how to get it. <---> There </---> is no delicate way to put it. Subatomic Studios' <+++> Fieldrunners 2 </+++> the sequel to their hit tower defense game will eat your soul and have you thanking it for the privilege. <---> Filled </---> with all the things that made its predecessor such a hit with its fans <+++> Fieldrunners 2 </+++> is the embodiment of the phrase 'if it ain't broke don't fix it'. You won't find unnecessary innovation here no awkward attempt to blend genres â <+++> Fieldrunners 2 </+++> knows what it is. <---> It </---> a tower defense game and a bloody good one at that. The controls are what you would expect of many tower defense games. <---> To </---> place a tower you simply drag and drop it onto the desired location on the screen. If you want to do anything else such as upgrade one of your many death-dealing facilities or make use of one of the game many power-ups you simply need to tap it. <---> While </---> the control scheme is simple enough the gameplay is something else entirely. I'm going to risk sounding inappropriately cheesy and tell you that there something for everyone in <+++> Fieldrunners 2 </+++>. Spread over twenty-five levels is a collection of almost every game mode known .
