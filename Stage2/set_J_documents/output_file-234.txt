The first BAFTA winning <+++> Cut the Rope </+++>Â [Free / $0. 99] did something that is almost unheard of outside of mobile gaming circles. <---> It </---> created a game that looked sounded and even played like something designed for young children that could be just as appealing and perplexing for adults. ZeptoLab second take on the cartoonish looking game <+++> Cut the Rope 2 </+++> [$1. 99] offers the same experience but with some creative twists that add new characters to the series and some equally creative ways to play one of the most popular puzzle games on the <---> iOS </---> platform. Thankfully the game doesn't stray too far from the concept that made it a mobile gaming monster. <---> The </---> loveable Om Nom the candy loving creature that was destined to become a best-selling huggable plush toy has an addiction for candy that cannot be satisfied and it up to the player to help him reach his glucose laden treasure. <---> This </---> time there is a slightly bigger emphasis on story as the pesky spiders conspire to steal his precious candy. This is to introduce some of the new characters that will help <---> Om Nom </---> retrieve his precious candy and set up new settings for Om Nom to play in as he travels around the world with his beloved candy dangling just out of his reach. <---> Like </---> most level-based puzzle games and its predecessor <+++> Cut the Rope 2 </+++>starts off slow to give the player a chance to learn its most basic functions and controls as ropes are sliced in perfect time to toss the candy into Om Nom infectious grin. <---> Things </---> like air cushions and balloons help keep the candy from falling off of a cliff and turning Om Non adorable grin into an awww producing frown but a bunch new characters .
