Take the most irrational and demanding mobile gaming fan â you know the kind the person that only wants paid games and hates in-app purchases and ads in any form â and ask them for a dream wishlist of everything they'd want from a mobile game. <---> What </---> they will describe to you is basically what <+++> Radiation Island </+++> [$2. 99] from Atypical Games delivers on. <---> It </---> a game that pushes iOS devices to their absolute limits provides PC-style gameplay on the go with gamepad support doesn't do much hand-holding delivers dozens of hours of gameplay offers online multiplayer and oh yeah it only $2. 99 for the entire package. <---> And </---> there not in-app purchases to be found anywhere in the vicinity of the game because those are for suckers right?.
