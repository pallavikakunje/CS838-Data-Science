I know <---> Pixelbite </---> focus has been making racing games all this time but man was the world of dual-stick shooters missing out. <+++> Xenowerk </+++> [$0. 99] is a more traditional dual-stick shooter affair than <+++> Space Marshals </+++> [$3. 99] a more tactical shooter with stealth elements. Regardless this is a ton of over-the-top fun. <---> If </---> you want a game that lets you blast a bunch of bugs into gooey puddles rewards you for playing well supports MFi controllers and will push your device to a degree that will make it an effective hand-warmer in the wintertime you'll love <+++> Xenowerk </+++>. <---> Each </---> level has a bunch of objectives but they're not exactly mentally tasking: they usually involve going to a spot and activating a switch blowing up an item or defeating a large enemy. They're just excuses to blast mutants. You're pretty much just trying to get to the end of the level without dying too much as you have a 3-star system to keep track of and a 1-star penalty for dying. The game rewards killing enemies in quick succession as you get combo bonuses for consecutive kills within a short amount of time. <---> Every </---> 5 of these chain kills rewards you with a bigger bonus so getting a lot of points requires racking up a big chain and the massive bonuses you get from it. And this is a game where getting three stars isn't an automatic reward for doing well. <---> No </---> three stars is something you have to earn. You need to go for those large chains when possible and knowing where the next closest enemies are on the map will help you out a lot in this goal. <---> Wiping </---> everyone out will get you 2 stars but 3 stars is an accomplishment. You lose .
