<+++> Yankai Triangle </+++> [$2. 99] is weird. It seems to have a never-ending number of stages. <---> Sometimes </---> it looks at you. The colors are subdued one level then shockingly bright the next. <---> The </---> scoring system is hard to make sense of. Everything is a little grainy. <---> The </---> eyes are watching. You might run into an absurdly difficult level followed by an astonishingly simple one immediately after. <---> Before </---> each level there are some symbols that mean something but it hard to say what unless you really watch carefully. Sometimes there are teeth. <---> The </---> game also introduces each and every level with a title card saying the level number followed with by Kenny Sun. <---> Perhaps </---> the weirdest thing of all is that you're not doing much more than spinning triangles around trying to match colors to make bigger triangles and yet it nearly impossible to put down. Your goal in each stage of <+++> Yankai Triangle </+++> is to spin the various triangle pieces around until they lock together into one big triangle. <---> Each </---> triangle has different colors along its outer angles. To lock two pieces together those colors must match. <---> Since </---> you'll need to match all but the outer set with multiple triangles you need to make sure that the side you're using isn't meant to be used by another piece. It starts off simple at first particularly if you have any experience with <+++> Triominoes </+++> but as you play through things get a lot more complicated. <---> Usually </---> a single tap makes the piece rotate once in a clockwise direction but in later levels you can't even count on those points. The game starts off quite gently for the first several dozen levels. <---> It </---> easy early on but the colors and perfect sound effects for spinning and locking pieces .
