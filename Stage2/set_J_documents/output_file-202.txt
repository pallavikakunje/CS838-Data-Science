I certainly do enjoy when a game provides its own pun especially when the pun actually checks out in all respects. <+++> Type: Rider </+++> [$2. 99] clever descriptive title is not only cute but also the first sign of the deliberate care and design to come for the player. <---> The </---> game which more or less is about riding type has some of the finest design I've seen in a long time with a constant barrage of new tricks and some details so subtle that you won't even pick up on them the first time through. It also quite informative particularly for someone like myself who knew very little of the history of type. <---> It </---> like a beautiful clever interactive documentary and although it stumbles a bit due to some technical issues the end result is a wonderful if sometimes aggravating experience that I'd recommend to anyone. <+++> Type: Rider </+++> takes you on a journey through the history of typography in which you play as two balls that likely represent a colon but could also be an umlaut I suppose. <---> The </---> game is broken up into ten worlds each one representing a particular era and using a particular font as a theme. The levels themselves are primarily composed of letters from that font and you'll need to roll and jump your way through them while picking up letters of the alphabet and asterisks. <---> Upon </---> picking up an asterisk you'll unlock some reading material that fills you in on some of the history connected to that particular world font and era. Somewhat ironically the spacing of the text in these readings is sometimes messed up and typographical errors abound. <---> Nevertheless </---> the readings are interesting and informative so I can forgive a few misplaced apostrophes and spaces. <---> The </---> worlds themselves are .
