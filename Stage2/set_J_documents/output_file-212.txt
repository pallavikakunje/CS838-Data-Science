Originally released in <---> September </---> of 2012 <+++> The Room </+++> [$0. 99 (HD)]Â wound up being a terrific puzzler from Fireproof Games. <---> It </---> was inventive it was gorgeous and it was devious. It made you think and when you figured out the answer you were wrong and it made you think some more. <---> Unfortunately </---> during the hustle and bustle of the holiday season our review for <+++> The Room Two </+++> [$1. 99] got lost in the mix but with its release just in time for Christmas the game took everything that made the original such an engrossing title and expanded on it. <---> The </---> puzzles are vastly more complex and multi-faceted the story while still being vague gets fleshed out a bit more the graphics have improved and the hair-pulling has multiplied. One of the first things youâll notice upon starting <+++> The Room Two </+++> is the addition of profiles. <---> Up </---> to three people can create a profile so if you want to pass the game around to your significant other or friend or mother who struggles to use a touchscreen but is amusing for you to watch than by all means. You wonât have to wait until you finish the game and then replay or let someone attempt to and possibly solve a puzzle before youâve had a chance to. Youâll be greeted with the familiar tutorial which basically follows that of the first game. <---> Control </---> in <+++> The Room Two </+++> is very precise. Everything you need to do requires an action of some sort whether thatâs swiping to open an envelope or circling clockwise to turn a rotating dial and the game is fluid in all of these motions. <---> As </---> you delve into the later chapters youâll trade in the standard creepy room for more creepy sets .
