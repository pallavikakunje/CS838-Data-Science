It almost the one-year anniversary of the release of <+++> Mikey Shorts </+++> [$1. 99 / Free] the platformer from <---> BeaverTap Games </---> that made such a splash in the world of iOS gaming. <---> It </---> garnered praise for absolutely nailing the controls and it was stuffed with tons of humorous unlockable costumes which added a very welcome aspect of customization as you played. Most importantly though <+++> Mikey Shorts </+++> excelled in level design and was able to provide a satisfying experience for those just looking to bounce around in a fun platformer as well as those who would memorize every little detail of a level and retry obsessively in an effort to shave fractions of a second off of completion times. I was in that latter group and I think that the best way to describe <+++> Mikey Shorts </+++>: an obsession. <---> If </---> you shared a similar experience as I did well get ready to fall off the wagon as <+++> Mikey Hooks </+++> [$1. 99] has finally arrived and it pretty much guaranteed to be your next obsession. <---> Everything </---> good about the original game makes a return here from the UI and menus to the disguise shop to the 3-star scoring system and moreâeverything feels familiar if you've played <+++> Mikey Shorts </+++> or the <---> Halloween </---> spinoff <+++> Mikey Shorts Halloween </+++> [Free]. There just one very big difference: the hooking. <---> Levels </---> contain many different anchor points in which you can launch a grappling hook to and swing from. It a pretty big addition to the core mechanics of the series but it easy as pie to warm up to. <---> Simply </---> holding down the jump button while you're in the air and an anchor point is highlighted will cause you to latch on and swing forward until you let off .
