At this point in <---> iOS </---> life it getting hard to find a new spin on the whole roguelite genre. Most of the people reading this probably own at least twice as many as they've had time to play. I suppose my job here is to try to convince you that you ought to add <+++> Dandy Dungeon </+++> [Free] to that pile because you really should. It bizarre in all the most likable possible ways and while its basic mechanics are familiar the way it presents them is definitely unique. <---> If </---> the general theme of say <+++> Katamari Damacy </+++> appealed to you this is a game you'll want to check out. Yamada is a 36-year old man who works at a software company. <---> He </---> doesn't care much about his job and instead wants to focus his efforts on his true passion of creating a game. The general flow of the game sees <---> Yamada </---> coding up some new element for his game then having you test the game by playing it. His game is a sort of roguelite dungeon crawl with an interesting twist. <---> On </---> each floor you have to draw a path for the hero to move along leading all the way to the exit. He'll fight any enemies he bumps into along the way collect any treasures and spring any traps. Once he in motion you can support him by using a variety of equipped items. <---> As </---> the hero defeats enemies he'll level up improving his stats and topping off his HP. Each time you play the game the hero starts from level one but any equipment you find is yours to keep. <---> These </---> are the two sides of <+++> Dandy Dungeon </+++>. On the one hand a fun casual roguelite with tons of things to collect level up .
