<+++> Legend of Grimrock </+++>[$4. 99] just landed on the app store. Almost Human decided it was time and I couldn't agree more. For those of you who are familiar this port doesn't disappoint. I never got the chance to play the PC version but I am convinced I have lost nothing in the translation. <---> If </---> you only play one dungeon delving game this summer I feel bad for you but it had better be <+++> Grimrock </+++>. <---> The </---> plot and general motivation for <+++> Grimrock </+++> is that you are a group of four prisoners cast into the top of a prison situated on top of a mountain. There are no guards preventing your exit only a myriad of monsters and traps waiting to destroy you as you attempt to vacate through the bottom of the tower. <---> If </---> you make it you are absolved of your crimes. The game is primarily a dungeon delving RPG with some puzzles and traps along the way. Character creation is very light compared to similar games. <---> You </---> pick a race choose the distribution of stats and allocate a handful of skill points and then you are off. No character sheet is needed just assign a few skill points each level and you are all set for the rest of the game. While I love in depth character customization <+++> Grimrock </+++> manages to make your characters feel like they fit their roles without drowning hours of time into character creation. <+++> LoG </+++> is a game that will hit all those nostalgic notes if you are old enough to remember any of the early D&D games or my personal favorite old school RPG The Bard Tale games. Your party has a single view panel and you move as a single entity filling up .
