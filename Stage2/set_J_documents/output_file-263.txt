Now <+++> Mikey Shorts </+++> isn't quite as complicated a game as <+++> Super Mario Bros. </+++> <---> But </---> that transcendent feeling when you time each jump perfectly and soar past every enemy? It right here and it brings me back to the late '80s piling on <---> Joan </---> sofa with a bunch of other kids and passing the controller back and forth. If I could just keep playing without dying I'd get to go a little longer. <---> That </---> mindset makes it awfully hard to put <+++> Mikey Shorts </+++> back down. Just one more level <---> please?Story </---> mode flies by in a flash. I sat down to give the game a look and bam 24 levels were under my belt. <---> But </---> that was just finishing the story taking in the old-school tunes and watching the odd little cutscenes. Everything about <+++> Mikey Shorts </+++> is a little strange visually speaking. <---> Thankfully </---> it plays a treat and there a lot more to enjoy than just the first time through the tale. Each story level has three goals: coins speed and shorts. <---> Collecting </---> every coin in a level sets one flag and you'll earn an achievement when you do so in every single level. Each level also has a hidden pair of golden shorts a great reason to go back and explore meticulously. <---> But </---> speed speed is where it at. There a star ranking based on how quickly you can make it through. <---> One </---> star is a reasonably good showing. Two stars is not half bad. <---> And </---> three stars requires a run a hand width short of perfection. You only jump when needed you never miss a jump or go the wrong way you hit every statue required to progress on the first try and the odd little patrolling robots don't get in your way. .
