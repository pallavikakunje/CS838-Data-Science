Good artists copy great artists steal. <---> It </---> a line that essentially means that explicitly mimicking something is easy enough to do â making a clone of a game is simple enough. But it another thing to take the ideas of one game and use them in another to create something that is original all in itself. <+++> Time Locker </+++> [Free] explicitly steals the gimmick of <+++> Superhot </+++> the first-person shooter where time only moves when the player moves. <---> It </---> even uses a very similar low-poly graphics style.

Because part of the issue is that <+++> Superhot </+++> has been cloned several times since its original 2013 game jam edition. <---> And </---> several clones of <+++> Superhot </+++> have shown up on the App Store. <---> But </---> the difficulty is not necessarily in replicating an idea it in creating it in the first place. Figuring out the concept of <+++> Superhot </+++> and implementing it into a fully-formed package took a lot of time! <---> And </---> sure it possible for unscrupulous developers to replicate it. Unity and other engines have made that super-easy. <---> But </---> what about a developer like <+++> Time Locker </+++> Sotaro Otsuka who pretty clearly decided to adapt this time-freeze system for his own game? <---> Well </---> that pretty much the basis of video games. <+++> Superhot </+++> is of course the byproduct of years of first-person shooter advances. <+++> Crossy Road </+++> is <+++> Frogger </+++> but adapted into an endless format with the .
