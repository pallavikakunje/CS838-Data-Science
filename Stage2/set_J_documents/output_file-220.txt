<+++> Capitals </+++> [Free] from NimbleBit is their take on a long-running genre: the turn-based multiplayer word game. <---> Thankfully </---> they manage to deliver a fun and worthwhile take on the genre by making it a simple strategy game that just uses familiar word game mechanics to feel familiar. It a game that accessible but leads to an intense battle between folks. <---> You </---> form words from tiles on a hex grid using Scrabble/Words With Friends [Free] rules with each tile you play being replaced by another tile. <---> Any </---> tiles you play connected to your color of tile are added to your tiles and if you capture the enemy capital you get an extra turn. Wipe out all the enemy territory and you <---> win!The </---> ultimate goal of <+++> Capitals </+++> is to protect your capital by not leaving any tiles around it vulnerable. By vulnerable I mean open and in a spot where the opponent could reach for it. So advancing on their capital and hopefully getting more territory in your back to back blows is important but if you leave yourself open a smart opponent will pounce on it. I've seen games where an opponent would lose their capital and still have a shot but it very tough. <---> Losing </---> a capital is meant to be a staggering punch to the jaw. And if you're really not careful you can lose in two turns. A certain editor of another mobile gaming site got punished multiple times that way. I'm so sorry. If you know your long and obscure <+++> Scrabble </+++> words you'll do well but because it a game of positioning a four-letter word may beat an eight-letter word. Q J and X tiles serve as barriers as well as impediments. That X might be blocking off an opponent best path .
