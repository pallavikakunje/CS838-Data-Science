Pretty much every week new puzzle games hit the <---> App </---> Store. It becomes increasingly hard to find innovative titles or puzzle games that are just plain fun. <---> Is </---> the game too hard? Too easy? Do I even care to get past the first twenty-plus stages? <+++> Help Me Fly </+++> [Free] from Funtomic is probably one of the smartest puzzle games Iâve played in a good while. <---> The </---> cartoonish visuals may seem like the game was designed for kids but this title is filled with circuitry delights that will appeal to even the most diligent puzzle-solving aficionado. The premise of this game is simple. <---> Your </---> biplane has run out of power. Youâve got to create a circuit that connects your biplane to a battery so that your pilot can take off. Middle school science teachers around the nation should be pleased by this game which uses a bit of trickery to get you into the electrical side of science. <---> Like </---> all puzzle titles the first few puzzles are about teaching you the mechanics of this game. The first fifteen out of sixty puzzles are definitely on the tutorial side. <---> But </---> then things start to get really intriguing. Youâve got <+++> Tetris </+++>-like blocks which serve as the wires in the circuit. Some of these blocks can be rotated while others canât be moved at all. <---> And </---> of course the blocks are dropped in deceptive positions which will lead you to approaching the solution from the wrong angle. Regardless of how tricky the puzzle I was anxious to solve it merely to hear the pilot scream âWooohoooâ when his biplane took off. It never got old especially with the cheerful music bed. <---> Although </---> <+++> Help Me Fly </+++> doesnât try to explicitly teach the nuances of circuitry there is an air .
