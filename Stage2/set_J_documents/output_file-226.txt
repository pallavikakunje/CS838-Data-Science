It been quite a wait for this third installment in inkle adaptation of <+++> Steve Jackson Sorcery! </+++> series of gamebooks. <---> It </---> kind of funny now to look back at those who were impatient over the six months between the release of the first two chapters. With just about a year and a half passed since the release of <+++> Sorcery! 2 </+++> [$4. 99] I imagine those people have champed right through the bit by now and have gone to work on biting their own faces off. With how consistently awesome inkle work has been on this series so far who can blame them though? <---> At </---> the same time I can't get too upset at the developer. <---> We </---> got the absolutely wonderful <+++> 80 Days </+++> [$4. 99] and the pleasant <+++> Down Among The Dead Men </+++> [$1. 99] in the interim and Android players got to get up to speed on the first two installments of the Sorcery! games. <---> Let </---> just hope that we don't have to wait quite so long for the final chapter. The gamebook landscape has changed in interesting ways since the first <+++> Sorcery! </+++> [$4. 99] launched on iOS. <---> At </---> the time nobody else was really playing around much with the gamebook concept. Mobile versions of gamebooks had digital dice and saved on carrying around a book and the presentation had been jazzed up a bit with digital color being a mite cheaper than doing the same in print but the essential experience was still slavish to the original paper-bound form of the genre. <---> In </---> the nearly two years that have passed since <+++> Sorcery! </+++> debut on iOS we've had things like <+++> Joe Dever Lone Wolf </+++> [Free] from <---> Forge Reply </---> <+++> Appointment With F. E. A. R. </+++> [$2. 99] .
