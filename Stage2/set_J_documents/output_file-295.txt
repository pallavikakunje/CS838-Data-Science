As I sit down to write this review I can't help but notice that it rather late in the day -- evening in fact. The plan was to get this post up and out hours ago. <---> The </---> problem here is the fact that I've been playing the game that is the focus of this review <+++> Forget-Me-Not </+++> [App Store] from <---> Nyarlu Labs </---> this entire day -- from initial download in the wee morning hours to moments ago. Whenever I managed to set it down just minutes later I felt that a little bit more research was needed. Â And I have no doubt that before this post is through yet more research will be called for. <---> That </---> is how excellent this retrolicious lovechild of PAC-MAN and <+++> Rogue </+++> truly is. <---> This </---> game is just awesome. It drops your blocky little onscreen avatar into the top level of the ever-changing pixellated NEON DUNJUN on a mission to collect flowers shoot monsters gather fruit grab the key and get to the next floor -- and fast lest the waving ghost of motivation appear! When you collect all the flowers on the floor the doorway to the next floor appears and from there you just need the key (which the monsters are fond of running off with). <---> Collect </---> as many flowers as you can in an unbroken sequence to see some real score multipliers kick in. You're constantly shooting in the direction you're headed but you're firepower (and health) can be increased with potions collected after slaying certain beasties. But there another attack mechanic at your disposal as well. <---> The </---> game utilizes a swipe-anywhere control system and you can swipe your next move while still heading down the current corridor. If you do until you get to the end you'll grind against .
