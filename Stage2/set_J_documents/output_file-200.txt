One day when youâre older you might think itâd be nice to retire to a small sleepy town and live out the remainder of your life happy surrounded by the rustling of trees and the rushing of water. <---> Or </---> evil things will happen and youâll wind up going crazy and then committing suicide which is apparently whatâs happened to the majority of the residents in <+++> Indigo Lake </+++> [$1. 99] a superb first-person survival horror game by ThreeCubes. It starts off simply enough you sitting on a boat in the middle of a lake. <---> Upon </---> picking up your first item which serves as an introduction to why youâre here and some slight back story the boat pulls alongside a dock and your adventure begins. One of the first things youâll notice despite the small size of the download are the graphics. <---> They </---> are terrific and really draws you into the creepy atmosphere surrounding everything. Leaves fall downward trees rustle buildings and environments are very well detailed. <---> Lighting </---> effects are great which youâll get to enjoy throughout the course of the game thanks to your ever trusty flashlight. Sound design is just as detailed as the graphics helping to draw you in further. <---> From </---> ambient noises to shuffling noises to the spectral noises to the odd cry of a baby that seems to pursue you now and then youâll really feel like youâre here in this town wondering what has happened. There is limited voice acting throughout which is a good thing; it sounds kind of forced and isnât all that good. <---> Within </---> the first minute of docking youâll come across a jeep which is yours for the taking and youâll soon find out why <+++> Indigo Lake </+++> is very open-ended and free roaming. You can drive pretty much .
