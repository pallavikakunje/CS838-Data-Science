Tightly-constructed well-executed charming different and entertaining are all words I feel like I can freely use when describing <+++> Zombieville 2 </+++>. For the most part it a near perfect iterative entry to the franchise. <---> It </---> artfully hones in on and turns up the volume on the two best parts of the original: the shooting and upgrade models. <+++> Zombieville 2 </+++> just gives you more -- more zombies more weapons more people to play as and more to unlock as you rummage through levels collecting cash from boxes and other environmental items. The upgrade model in particular is a killer. <---> Like </---> a modern <+++> Call of Duty </+++> this game has a tendency to inspire constant replays as the next best weapon or character perk is always just a few more sessions away. A smarter Xbox-like button system allows for up to three weapon switching on the fly while the harder-hitting melee weapons ensures you're never up the proverbial creek and unable to defend yourself against the zombie hordes that populate each of its cutesy though still post-zombie armageddon environments. <+++> Zombieville 2 </+++> introduces several key changes including a huge out-of-game item store. <---> For </---> me the most impfactful change is its re-moldeled structure. Levels are now instance-based and timed and you move between them freely. <---> For </---> the most part the free-form appeal of the action has been retained. Whatever you do during your time in a level be it running steadily to the right or staying put is up to you. <---> This </---> puts everything that happens on your terms -- you pick the weapons you pick the approach and you choose how and when to kill. You probably won't come out of the action with a <---> ZombieVille Moment </---> to share with friends since the core model isn't all .
