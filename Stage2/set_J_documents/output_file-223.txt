There a certain craft that goes into making a game that feels great. <---> Protostar </---> <+++> Checkpoint Champion </+++> [Free] is a fun game on its own but the game shows a certain craftsmanship that elevates the whole experience.

What Protostar decided to do with <+++> Checkpoint Champion </+++> was to make this game look as nice as possible. <---> Polished </---> is such an overused word but that really what this is. Every piece of art every button is all in the same style defined with thick lines. <---> The </---> visuals are detailed and the game runs very smoothly on the latest hardware though some of the effects can be disabled in order to improve performance on earlier devices. There Game Center leaderboards for every level. <---> There </---> picture and video sharing. Even the hidden checkpoints are just a nice touch. <---> There </---> just so many little things that were clearly done in order to make this game look and feel as nice as possible and it shows. It makes the experience of playing feel as good as possible. <---> There </---> really only two 'courses' per se but the game makes the most out of them by using a variety of layouts and events within those courses.
