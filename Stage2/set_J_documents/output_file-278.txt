Stealth games are notoriously fickle things; genetically linked to arcade stock that treats players like quarter-pumping cattle stealthâs central conceits have revolved around failure punishment and the gaming of its systems instead of things like fun and rewards. <+++> Spy Mouse </+++> mitigates a lot of the not-so-fabulous parts of its mechanics by being pretty up-front about its moment-to-moment stealth: it clearly shows you enemy pathways its top-down perspective quickly gives you a handle on what you can do and when and itâs mechanically simple which eliminates the need to execute grand schemes or interact with complicated systems in second-long bursts. <---> In </---> a couple of words itâs strikes me as a âbalancedâ game. It isnât super action heavy and as forgiving as the new <+++> <html><body><a href=http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Tom_Clancy_Splinter_Cell>Splinter Cell</a></body></html> </+++> title but itâs also not as stringent as an earlyÂ  <+++> <html><body><a href=http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Metal_Gear>Metal Gear</a></body></html> </+++> or a <+++> <html><body><a href=http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Hitman_(series)>Hitman</a></body></html> </+++>. Itâs challenging without being stupidly hard; its AI is predictable but capable; its level design allows for autonomy without sacrificing a vision; its boss battles are tough while simultaneously entertaining; and it gives you just enough information to succeed without overloading you. Itâs also pretty pure. This is a game about a mouse grabbing cheese underneath catsâ noses. <---> The </---> cats patrol on highlighted pathways while you move around similarly to how you draw a planeâs path in <+++> Flight Control </+++>. Itâs indirect movement but it serves the game well and keeps pacing on an even keel ensuring few stealth Oh Crap Get Behind The Wall Quick messes. <---> There </---> are times in which I really really want more direct control over my character but those are few and frankly itâs because Iâm approaching situations in stupid ways. <---> Just </---> like <+++> Flight Control </+++> <+++> Spy Mouse .
