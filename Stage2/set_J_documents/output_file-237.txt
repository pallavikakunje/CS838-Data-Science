There so many <+++> Angry Birds </+++> games out there that listing them all would make for an incredibly obnoxious opening paragraph. <---> Originally </---> released in 2009 I'm not sure anyone could've predicted that <+++> Angry Birds </+++> would turn into the worldwide empire it has since become. It been a long road and <---> Rovio </---> is no stranger to sequels spinoffs and movie tie-ins at this point so I'm not sure anyone was surprised when <+++> Angry Birds Star Wars II </+++> was announced. Regardless we loved <+++> Angry Birds Star Wars </+++> [$0. 99 / Free] in our review so it'd only stand to reason that the sequel is just as good- <---> If </---> not better. While the original <+++> Angry Birds Star Wars </+++> followed the original trilogy <+++> Angry Birds Star Wars II </+++> [Free] takes a step backwards <---> (Or </---> is it forwards?) to the more-recently released prequel trilogy. Initially this puts you in charge of <---> Obi-Wan Kenobi </---> and Qui-Gon Jinn birds with the rest of the cast joining in later levels. <---> Sure </---> it easy to groan at the prequel trilogy but like <+++> Angry Birds Star Wars </+++> the movies really only serve as the absolute most barebones frame for the levels of the game to progress through. Essentially instead of just being in some random nondescript <+++> Angry Birds </+++> location poppin' pigs you're doing it on planets like Naboo. <---> More </---> interesting than the story framework however is the ability to actually play as the pigs for the first time ever in an <+++> Angry Birds </+++> game. Unsurprisingly when you join the pork side the pigs play almost exactly like the birds but with their own on-tap power that fits their character. <---> Playing </---> as the pigs provides a neat spin on the gameplay but <+++> Bad Piggies .
