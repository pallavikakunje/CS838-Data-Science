Someone at <---> Popcannibal </---> has clearly done some event planning in the past because <+++> Girls Like Robots </+++> [$2. 99] is the game of seating arrangements brought to utterly delightful life. Absent are the tensions of family dynamics and in their place are schoolroom dramas: who likes whom which one the pariah and who would really just like to be left alone. <---> Here </---> a primer: girls like robots but they hate nerds. Robots are cool with just about everyone but can't be left alone with fish. <---> And </---> nerds? Well they'd like to sit next to girls but robots are pretty cool too. <---> Â Hope </---> that clear because it just the start of navigating this social puzzle minefield. Seating is a loose concept here. <---> You </---> arrange your little friends as tiles on a grid. Each one -- and there are far more than girls robots nerds and fish -- has his or her own likes and dislikes which get revealed over time. <---> If </---> something beloved is on all four sides of a tile it will be the happiest it can be. If it surrounded by the things it hates there will be abject misery. <---> Happiness </---> is your goal and your currency so you have to do your best to avoid making people unhappy and do your best to offset it when it unavoidable. Most of the <+++> Girls Like Robots </+++>' hundred plus levels are logic puzzles but few have exact right or wrong solutions. <---> Happiness </---> is a spectrum. Some times you'll fill a grid with thrilled individuals and leave the happiness requirements in the dust. <---> Other </---> times you'll mash the undo button over and over as you try to find the best of a bunch of despondent solutions. The game does everything it can to help you along -- a happiness .
