It took me a long time to beat <---> Grapefrukt </---> <+++> Rymdkapsel </+++> [$3. 99] a second time even after playing it for a week. Martin Jonasson minimalistic pared-down real-time strategy game is hard no doubt but I was also hesitant to wipe my winning station off the screen: around a brightly-colored core of barracks defense rooms and gardens my space station halls stretched infinitely out into the stars like a giant cosmic cephalopod whose legs only bend at right angles. It wasÂ pretty and I'd worked hard and I wasn't ready to erase it yet. <+++> Rymdkapsel </+++> is a base-building game. Stranded in space surrounded by mysterious monoliths to explore and resources to extract you play as a deistic task-manager charged with assigning tasks to two-pixel minions and expanding a color-coded space station as far as possible. <---> Gardens </---> are green and kitchens are yellow and you'll need both in order to grow enough food to feed the would-be engineers builders and researchers living in orange barracks. In <+++> Rymdkapsel </+++> tetromino-shaped rooms can only be built on corridors not other rooms. <---> Once </---> you drag-and-drop them into place tap the screen to rotate them. You'll need to expand your base far enough to reach each monolith (the game ends when all four are fully researched) but waves of laser-toting enemies will attack periodically. And âŚ that it -- <+++> Rymdkapsel </+++> flat primary-colored visuals and sparse synth soundtrack are perfectly matched to its simple straightforward mechanics. <---> Jonasson </---> game is a real-time strategy game without the variable minutiae that make the genre so traditionally opaque. There are only three resources to manage one type of unit to build and one type of enemy to ward off and every element is visually represented by simple geometry or primitive pixel art. <---> Nothing </---> is modeled .
