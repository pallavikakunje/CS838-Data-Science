In <+++> Wooords </+++> instead of typing words in (or writing them in a newspaper) you simply slide fridge-magnets around to form words anywhere on the screen. <---> The </---> letters don't have to be perfectly lined up just adjoining as the game is clever enough to detect when a word is formed and you'll be rewarded with a burst of stars a happy sound and some points. An awful lot of effort went into this design decision too. <---> For </---> instance as you move the fridge-magnets they make little clinking noises as they collide with each other. If you drag a letter between two other letters they ease apart to make room. <---> And </---> if you form a larger word the letters subtly decrease in size so the word fits on the screen. If you shake your device the letters are randomly re-arranged. <---> It </---> shocking how well this all works. There three game modes to choose from. <---> In </---> 'Classic' mode you have unlimited time to form words which are rewarded by points and stars. Achieving one star unlocks the next puzzle (30 in total) but real satisfaction comes from obtaining the maximum three stars. <---> This </---> mode is about skill and persistence rather than speed. The second mode is <---> 'Daily </---> Words' which is a daily competition to rank yourself against yourself friends or the world. A fresh set of letters is released every 24 hours which gives this game daily re-playability. <---> And </---> lastly there 'Word Jam' which places an emphasis on both speed and skill. <---> The </---> goal is to reach the target score within the word and time limit. This involves completing quick-fire rounds so speed is definitely a factor here. <+++> Wooords </+++> can be played casually for fun but don't let the cute magnets fool you this can also be a competitive .
