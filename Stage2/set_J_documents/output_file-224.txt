It feels like forever since the original <+++> Jet Car Stunts </+++> [$1. 99] was released. <---> All </---> the way back in 2009 this arcade racer blurred the lines between a typical vehicular experience and 3D platformers. <---> It </---> was silly occasionally frustrating and mostly fun which is a legacy that <+++> Jet Car Stunts 2 </+++> [Free] lives up to. Fundamentally this is the same game you know and love but with a bunch of new content added on top and controller support. <---> You </---> might think this is just a standard racing game but once you actually give it a try it'll probably change your genre conventions a bit to say the least. Your main objective is to get from point A to B through any means necessary usually through massive jumps nitro boosts and healthy amounts of speed. <---> Â Each </---> level has a three medal rating scheme as well as a general score system so you'll always strive to get better. Even with a set of upgraded visuals <+++> Jet Car Stunts 2 </+++> isn't something you'll want to use to show off your device. <---> It </---> pretty basic at its core offering up simple visuals that get the job done without getting too flashy. There also no music -- just the sounds of your engine to keep you company. <---> Â Having </---> said that although it not technically impressive I absolutely love the abstract floating design of the game world. <---> It </---> evokes a sci-fi element that isn't found in most racing games which makes the <+++> Jet Car Stunts </+++> series pretty unique. Â Think floating <---> Tetris </---> pieces and you'll have a good idea of what to expect. This is mostly a silly racer built around fun so precision isn't really its strong suit. <---> Using </---> the accelerometer is often times an exercise in frustration .
