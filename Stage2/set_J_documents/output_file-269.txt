It works a little something like this- <---> You </---> start a game with someone (I've found games with people you actually know via Facebook seem to be the most fun. ) and are given the choice of three words of varying difficulty. <---> You </---> choose one do your best to draw it and hit submit. Your friend gets a push alert sees your drawing and is given a array of scrambled letters to spell the word with. <---> If </---> they guess correctly you're awarded between one and three coins they take their turn and the process repeats. The free to play mechanic is actually sort of neat as you can play the free version for eternity with ads and a limited set of colors to draw with. <---> Alternatively </---> you can spring for the 99Â˘ ad-free version. The coins you earn are used to either buy bombs which nuke some of the letter tiles which don't go to the word you're supposed to guess or buy more colors to paint with. <---> Sure </---> you can just do your drawings in the few colors that everyone gets but to really tweak out your illustrations you need at least a few more paint sets. The rub of the coin system is that actually earning enough coins by playing to buy bombs and unlock paint sets takes forever which means you basically have to buy them unless you're way more patient than I am. But at the end of the day I'm having a really hard time getting that worked up over the IAP as the game is worth every penny worth of the $4. 99 bucket of coins I bought to unlock a bunch of paint (and the 99Â˘ I dropped to get the ad-free version). Recently the game was updated with additional words and complete support .
