Has it really only been four years? <---> Four </---> years since <+++> Canabalt </+++> [$2. 99] burst onto the scene and arguably created and inarguably popularized a genre? Looking around the <---> App Store </---> today it hard to remember a time before endless runners let alone the idea that it all happened in less time than it took to make a fourth <+++> Spider-Man </+++> movie. The genre has certainly built quite a bit on top of the framework set by its originator as well. <---> Perspective </---> changes missions power-ups level-ups currency vehicles mini-games character customization and more have been added to the genre resulting in amazing games like <+++> Temple Run </+++> [Free] <+++> Punch Quest </+++> [Free] and <+++> Jetpack Joyride </+++> [Free]. Still as we felt when we recently took a look back at <+++> Canabalt </+++> there something about the game minimalism and tight mechanics that allow it to continue to stand out among the razzle and dazzle of its successors. I'm talking about all of this because in many ways <+++> Boson X </+++> [$2. 99] seems to have discarded almost all the frills and gimmicks developed in the last four years of evolution going back to the core of what made <+++> Canabalt </+++> such a great game. <---> There </---> are no coins to pick up here nor can you collect power-ups or count on upgrades to make your character stronger. There is your character the path ahead of him and precious little in the way of mercy. <---> Momentum </---> and lightning fast reflexes are the key to survival. That not to say that the game ignores its contemporaries entirely because there is a healthy splash of <+++> Super Hexagon </+++> [$2. 99] on the canvass here as well. <---> Like </---> that game <+++> Boson X </+++> is both endless .
