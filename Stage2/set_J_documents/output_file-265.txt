As I mentioned back when I reviewed <+++> Monument Valley </+++> [$3. 99] it was bound to be a love it or hate it affair and I was actually pleasantly surprised to see that most people felt as strongly about the experience as I did. It a beautiful thing to play with an artfully-constructed world that you can manipulate and bend around in ways that only a few other games have allowed. <---> It </---> was a gorgeous pure experience free of the flashing lights and urging pace that seems to be the general speed of things in this wonderful hobby of ours. It was also very short with a mere ten levels to its tale about a third of which were basically tutorial stages. <---> By </---> the time it turned up the gas even a little bit it was soon finished. As an experience it hard to argue with it. <---> As </---> a mechanical game it was a whole lot of potential with a somewhat wanting level of realizing it. Generally it was very well-received with most people left crying for more. <---> So </---> developer Ustwo got working on some more and after several months of development they've released an expansion for <+++> Monument Valley </+++> called <+++> Forgotten Shores </+++>. As I see it there were a few boxes to check off with this expansion. First and foremost simply delivering more content was important for those who were still thirsty for more after the original set of stages. <---> Second </---> it was important to deliver an experience at the same level of quality as the original game. Finally seizing some of that gameplay potential ought to have been a priority. <---> In </---> my opinion <+++> Forgotten Shores </+++> checks off that entire list. For the price of $1. 99 half the cost of the base .
