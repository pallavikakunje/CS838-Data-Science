To tell you the truth friends I'm actually pretty busy working on something today. <---> That </---> said I was asked to come and write something for all of you about the new follow-up to <---> Luca Redwood </---> 10000000 [$2. 99]. It called <+++> You Must Build A Boat </+++> [$2. 99] and it every bit as compelling as the first game. <---> Did </---> you like the first game? Do you enjoy puzzle games? <---> Do </---> you like games? You're going to want this one trust me. The premise of the first game had you escaping from a prison by achieving a certain score. <---> You </---> had to eke out upgrade after upgrade bumping up your multiplier in the hopes of making just a little bit farther each time. In this one you've got nothing but freedom ahead of you. <---> The </---> only thing is you need a boat. A little boat will do at first but you'll soon need a bigger one. <---> To </---> get the necessary resources you'll have to drop anchor and test yourself against the local wildlife. In doing so you'll collect gold gather items new crew members and monsters all of which will help you become stronger in one way or another. <---> Once </---> you've grabbed everything from one location you'll pull up the anchor and sail on. The game even keeps track of your time on each leg so that you can try to beat it again more quickly once you've finished. <---> In </---> terms of mechanics the core hasn't changed much. You'll see your guy running across the top of the screen while you play on the lower half. You'll have to slide rows and columns to match at least three of one type of piece in order to launch attacks shore up your defense or unlock chests. While you're matching the screen .
