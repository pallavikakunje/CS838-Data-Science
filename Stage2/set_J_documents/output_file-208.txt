Remember <+++> Cube Runner </+++> [Free]? <---> Of </---> course you do. It was probably one of the first games you put on your <---> iPhone </---> back in the day. It had some smooth 3D visuals and fun quick-reaction type gameplay that was a perfect fit for mobile. Well flash forward five or six years and the <---> New Hotness </---> in town is a little game by Flippfly called <+++> Race the Sun </+++> [$4. 99] which isâŚ well itâs pretty much the same thing. <---> So </---> why is everyone getting so excited about it?Iâll tell you why. (In fact thatâs literally my job. ) <---> But </---> first let me explain what it is. In <+++> Race the Sun </+++> you play as a sleek little spaceship flying through a completely flat landscape with a bunch of random geometric objects strewn about. <---> You </---> need to tap the left and right sides of the screen to fly between them or else youâll be turned into a glowing puff of smoke faster than you can blink. (Pro tip: Donât blink. ) <---> So </---> far so <+++> Cube Runner </+++> right?Well not quite. <---> But </---> there isnât really one major thing that sets <+++> Race </+++> apart from <+++> Cube </+++>; rather itâs a dozen smaller things. The controls feel better. <---> The </---> speeds are faster. The environments are more varied and interesting. <---> There </---> are ramps that send you flying through the air portals that whisk you into other dimensions and great big shadows that sap your fuel. Plus the levels change to something new every single day so youâll never get bored. Itâs really brilliant how it all comes together and itâs a total blast. <---> Outside </---> of the gameplay itself there are some pretty major differences. First of all thereâs a three tiered mission system like <+++> Jetpack Joyride </+++> [Free]. .
