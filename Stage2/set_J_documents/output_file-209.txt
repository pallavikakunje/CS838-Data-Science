I must admit <+++> Prune </+++> [$3. 99] snuck up on me though it probably shouldn't have. <---> Made </---> by ex-AAA developers out of <---> Madison </---> apparently the game had been floating around the midwestern games scene and I somehow missed it until I got an email about it a couple days ahead of launch. And holy heck do I wish I had seen this sooner because <+++> Prune </+++> is a gorgeous and unique experience. <---> It </---> not really like anything you've played in that it a game about tree pruning. You draw a line from the base provided in order to draw the tree upward from which it starts sprouting branches. <---> Now </---> to help it grow you must trim off certain branches which will cause other parts of the tree to grow bigger and better. Essentially the more substantial the trim the more that the rest of the tree can grow though if you cut off a branch it won't grow any further. <---> Each </---> level gives you the goal of getting the tree to grow a certain amount of flowers generally by coming in contact with light. Where the fun and challenge of <+++> Prune </+++> comes in is that you have to deal with elements like wind suns that will accelerate or corrupt your tree growth and more. You'll have to grow and prune your tree around difficult circumstances. <---> The </---> game does a great job at throwing all sorts of interesting challenges your way keeping you on your toes for as to what might come next. There loads of variety across the several dozen levels here. <+++> Prune </+++> goes a long way to avoid any form of frustration. <---> If </---> you fail at a level too many times it'll offer you the opportunity to skip it. Any solution really has .
