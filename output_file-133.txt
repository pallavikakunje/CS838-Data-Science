Card games are extremely difficult to make in my estimation: the game has to provide a rigid set of rules while having to deal with randomness in a way that feels fair while reveling in the entropy that comes from not knowing what next. I don't know if <+++> Card Crawl </+++> [$2. 99] ever completely succeeds in that respect in terms of fairness with the randomness. But it does an excellent enough job otherwise at making a game that super-fun with an interesting set of rules that I struggle to put this one down. The game plays with a 54-card deck based on a 52-card deck (not counting the 2 jokers) where you have a player card two hands and a backpack slot for items. <---> Cards </---> that are drawn consist of swords shields potions coins enemies and five ability cards randomly selected from the ones you have unlocked. Four cards are drawn at a time and you must play 3 of the drawn ones in order to draw another 3 hopefully getting to the point where no cards are left without running out of health from enemy attacks first. <---> There </---> are two key goals to each game one of which is surviving but the other is coming out with as much money as possible. You can sell item cards you don't want getting coins back for how many points the card was worth and you can discard coin and ability cards for no penalty. <---> As </---> such sometimes a draw with a lot of items can be a bad thing because you may have to sell or discard a valuable item which could hurt you later on. And if you're playing for high scores then you need to be going for every coin card you can and selling items whenever .
