It fun to think back to the launch of the <---> Xbox </---> 360 in 2005 when out of all the possible choices for a breakout early hit the one that most gamers flocked to was the humble <+++> Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved </+++>. Starting as an in-house test demo it still amazing to me that this little game not only carried a console through the dry launch period all hardware suffers from but also dragged a sub-genre back into viability where it still sits to this day. <---> Suddenly </---> twin-stick shooters were popular and prolific in a way they perhaps never were before. Mobiles have particularly enjoyed the fruits of that success with a load of great twin-stick shooters already and more releasing all the time. <---> But </---> although the genre was fairly quiet in the years prior to <+++> Geometry Wars </+++> like any dormant genre it wasn't completely dead. One particular standout was 2003 <+++> Crimsonland </+++> [Free] an early effort from a name many <---> iOS </---> gamers know quite well 10tons Entertainment. Okay it a slight misnomer to call it a twin-stick shooter. <---> It </---> was a top-down WASD-mouse shooter if we're to be technical about these things. The game offered solid action a huge arsenal of weapons and perks and mild RPG elements. Well perhaps 10tons is feeling nostalgic for their old days because earlier this year they released a special HD version of the game on PC PlayStation 4 and Vita. <---> It </---> taken a few more months but that remake is now available to iOS gamers. <---> The </---> core gameplay is very simple placing you in a closed-in arena with tons of enemies spawning everywhere. You have to survive by killing them all with whatever weapons you can get your hands on and my goodness there are a lot of them. .
