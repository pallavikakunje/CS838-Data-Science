<+++> Her Story </+++> [$2. 99] is one of the more unique games I have played in recent memory by far. <---> At </---> its core you're just browsing a search engine trying to find the right queries for what you're looking for but that pretty much irrelevant. <+++> Her Story </+++> is a mystery where you have a mystery involving dozens of segments of police interviews with a woman where you're trying to piece together the mystery at hand. The game is about putting together the disparate pieces paying attention to clues to discover the truth of what happened with the woman and her missing husband. <---> The </---> story is the star here and I'm going to be as vague as possible here so that you can discover its secrets and surprises for yourself. Try to avoid spoilers of any sort because it so much more rewarding to discover the truth than to just read it and to have those sudden realizations happen to you when you do. <---> You </---> interact with <+++> Her Story </+++> by sitting at a simulated computer terminal with a collection of the videos from two years ago. These are composed of seven different interviews but chopped up into a bunch of different short videos. <---> The </---> in-game justification for this is that the videos were digitized a while back were split up as part of a database and thanks to a flood you only have the woman footage not the detective questioning. And then Y2K messed up some stuff and this is all that been recovered. You can search to pull up videos with words matching from what the woman has said and have those videos pop up. <---> But </---> here the thing: in a technical justification for making sure that you can't search for the and watch all .
