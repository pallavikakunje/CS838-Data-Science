If you think you're all <---> Tower </---> Defense'd out be prepared for the tables to turn. Ayopa Games have set their sights on a time honored genre that is to be honest usually pretty outdated. <+++> Sleep Attack TD </+++>[$2. 99] is their first foray into tower defense. <---> Our </---> forums have been buzzing about this game for good reason. With the bright asthetic <---> Ayopa </---> is known for and some very unique gameplay <+++> Sleep Attack </+++> brings some much needed defibrillation to a category of games that seems to be in constant danger of completely flat lining. <+++> Sleep Attack </+++> is a traditional tower defense game with a big spin. Actually two big spins. <---> Most </---> maps in the game are basically one large turn table with a slightly smaller turn table on top of it. You build towers on the tables and then rotate each one to preset quarter turn positions independently throughout the game. <---> Gameplay </---> is paused while you are rotating a table. There is no limit to how many times you can rotate or how long you have to rotate. <---> Towers </---> are only buildable in set locations but as a game progresses more and more spots will open up. I really appreciate the pause you get by rotating the board. <---> It </---> allows for planning even in the middle of a wave of enemies. It no secret I have a lot of appreciation for opportunities to make tactical choices. Even in a genre as strategic as tower defense <+++> Sleep Attack </+++> has improved on the time-tested formula. <---> The </---> premise of the story line is that you are defending a big monster that loves to eat junk food and play video games and managed to pass out by doing it for entirely too long. And monsters want to attack .
