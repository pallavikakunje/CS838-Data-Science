If you've played a <---> Monster </---> and Monster game before you will probably already be familiar with their ability to turn atmospheric chiptune music and simple yet detailed pixel graphics into a great mood driven experience. <+++> Autumn Walk </+++> [Free] and <+++> Winter Walk </+++> [Free] live and breathe on this adorable mood they instill. <---> If </---> you think <+++> Deep Loot </+++> [Free] is going to give you a similar experience however you are going to be in for some surprises at what else the game has in store for you. <+++> Deep Loot </+++> is an adventure exploration game that focuses on funny enough dredging up loot as an ocean diver. As you dive you will combat sea creatures as well as recover gold and relics. <---> The </---> relics are put on display in your warehouse. They serve as a long term completion goal as well as some nice eye candy. <---> Certain </---> dives might even result in finding a message in a bottle which kicks off a small story line that develops slowly as you find more bottles. At first glance the visuals are blocky even for a pixel art game. <---> As </---> you and your diver both get deeper into the game however you will find more and more little discoveries that include a greater level of detail than the typical blocks you swim past. The game really draws you into these areas and they make each dive a little more unique. <---> The </---> game starts off slow. Your first few dives might feel pretty similar without too much to differentiate them. <---> After </---> my first 10 or so dives I started wondering if my guy was invincible. <---> The </---> fish and crabs I encountered near the surface were weak and easily killed. I decided to grab one of the amazing boosts this .
