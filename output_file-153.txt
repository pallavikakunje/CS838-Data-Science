Earlier this year a cute little puzzle RPG named <+++> Glyph Quest </+++> [Free] was released. It was one of those games that was pretty hard to put down until it was finished but it was unfortunately also one of those games that finished a bit too quickly. <---> The </---> game used the shareware-style model of being free to download and play up until a certain level at which point you could pay to unlock the rest of the game. That a great way to do things but it hid one of the game most interesting gameplay features behind that paywall so I think a lot of people ended up sleeping on it. Well the developer back to take another kick at the can with <+++> Super Glyph Quest </+++> [$3. 99] a sort of-sequel that keeps the same great core of the original while simultaneously attempting to address most of its faults. <---> Depending </---> on what your particular issues were with the first game there a good chance you'll find this version of the game to be good enough to kick the original off of your device for good. The story takes place 1000 years after the first game with a new customizable character as the lead. <---> Like </---> in the first game it mostly an excuse to cart out jokes and humorous pop culture references with an added layer of absurdity coming from sidequests featuring characters from pigeon dating simulation <+++> Hatoful Boyfriend </+++> and popular comic book <+++> Skullkickers </+++>. One of the criticisms I made in my review of the first game was that it was a bit light on content. By comparison the sequel is packed with quests and when you finish those there still an endless mode to play along with several missions that can be repeated as many .
