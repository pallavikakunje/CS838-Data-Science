I'd like you to imagine an alternate universe where Rare/Ultimate Play The Game Spectrum classic <+++> Jetpac </+++> wasn't just a huge hit but was so influential that developers were still doing their own spins and refinements on it for generations to come. I'd also like you to imagine that people in that world are obsessed with cute fluffy sheep. <---> In </---> that dimension something like the newest game in the <+++> Air Supply </+++> series from developer Quantum Sheep might seem somewhat pedestrian. <---> In </---> our reality however <+++> Air Supply - SOS </+++> [$1. 99] action-packed twist on the Rare classic is pretty special. <---> It </---> occurs to me that I should clarify that this game has nothing to do with the band since someone always asks. <---> Up </---> until now the <+++> Air Supply </+++> series has paid respects to the UK classic computer in its presentation but the auto-running gameplay has had its feet firmly planted in modern mobile trends. <---> This </---> time though there no going back. This is the kind of game that used to rule the roosts albeit with a few extra ideas to keep its vintage feel from turning rusty. <---> The </---> premise isn't too far from <+++> Jetpac </+++> at its core. You play as <---> Spaceman Sam </---> at least initially and in each single-screen stage you have to rescue a set number of sheep that descend into the play area. All you have to do is fly over them to pick them up then drop them off by touching your ship. <---> Once </---> your rocket ship is full of wooly creatures you blast off to the next stage. Of course it not quite that simple. <---> Aliens </---> of all shapes and types are flying out of the sides of the screen constantly UFOs will occasionally descend to lay out a ridiculous .
