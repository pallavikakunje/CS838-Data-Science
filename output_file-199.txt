As much as it might punish me for it I have difficulty putting <+++> Duet </+++> [$2. 99] down. As it did with both <+++> Bean Quest </+++> [$2. 99] and <+++> Time Surfer </+++>[$0. 99] <---> Kumobius </---> has tapped into a potent combination in its new game this time exploring simple action electronic music and death. Quite a bit of the latter. <---> There </---> a bit of <+++> Super Hexagon </+++> [$2. 99] in <+++> Duet </+++> bloodline. When you find yourself tapping the right and left sides of the screen to rotate semi-static figures amidst obstacles there a certain familiarity. <---> But </---> this game isn't playing with stale material. Its steps are powerful. <---> You </---> control two circles bound by a ring. The ring is illustrativeâit won't hit obstacles. <---> The </---> circles will though so you rotate them around each other to slip past wall after wall. Slip one down to the left and the other swings up to the right and both must always bypass whatever stands in their way. <---> This </---> results in a fluid dance with one side leading. In a given level you might need to swing them past half a dozen static walls. <---> Later </---> it more than a dozen and they're moving as you go. <+++> Duet </+++> is rarely easy and the evidence of your failure is left behind with splatters on the wall. Each set of levels is given a title one of the five <---> KĂźbler-Ross </---> stages of grief and a few things beyond. Meditations on the subjects lead into the action and carry the narrative. <---> Thematically </---> this risks being a touch overwrought but Tim Shiel outstanding soundtrack effortlessly sells the mood . I'd be better at <+++> Duet </+++> if I could play without sound but that would be too great a waste. It not that the .
