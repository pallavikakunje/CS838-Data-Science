It may have a name that calls to mind bright red birds or baseball but <+++> Cardinal Quest </+++> [$3. 99] is a pretty cool roguelike. <---> Originally </---> released on PC and later ported to <---> iOS </---> in 2012 it basically boils the genre concept down and streamlines it as much as possible. Interestingly the way the developer went about simplifying it didn't so much remove depth as take the direct responsibility for handling it out of the player hands. <---> It </---> proved to be a great fit for mobile platforms and has a good following of fans including me. Unfortunately for me when I finally made the jump to newer hardware than my creaky old iPhone 4 I was a bit heartbroken to find that <+++> Cardinal Quest </+++> didn't work very well anymore thanks to the new dimensions of the screen. I was left waiting for the announced sequel and after a fairly lengthy soft launch period <+++> Cardinal Quest 2 </+++> [Free] is finally here. <---> It </---> could be argued that perhaps the greatest distinguishing trait the first game had was its lean nature. In most respects it was like many other roguelikes. <---> You </---> moved a character turn-by-turn through a randomized dungeon floor battling monsters gaining levels picking up treasure and looking for the exit to the next floor. What you encountered along the way was as random as the layouts so monsters and treasure were wildly different from one playthrough to the next. <---> Naturally </---> it also had one of the defining elements of the genre: permadeath. If you ran out of health and didn't have any resurrection tricks up your sleeve well that too bad. <---> It </---> game over and you may not press start to continue. The challenge and appeal in games of this genre is learning how to make .
