Some of the earliest video game <---> RPGs </---> were roguelikes but if you didn't notice them around for a couple of decades nobody would blame you. After being fairly popular in the early stages of home computing they soon gave way to bigger more persistent adventures. <---> They </---> still had a dedicated following during those years with games like <+++> Nethack </+++> <+++> Angband </+++> and Japan <+++> Mystery Dungeon </+++> series carrying the torch for the genre. <---> The </---> boom of indie developers and the surging interest in more compact gaming experiences in the last ten years has seen the genre make a big comeback. The basic elements of the genre have been used in many popular games that might not be strictly considered roguelikes but owe a massive debt to the genre nonetheless. A genre once almost totally represented by so few games that you could count them off on your fingers now has a strong influence especially in the PC and mobile gaming markets. <---> That </---> has resulted in some very interesting and enjoyable variations on the theme. One that went over very well and rightfully so was 2012 FTL [$9. 99 (HD)] from Subset Games which rolled the basic spirit of a roguelike into a spaceship sim to create something entirely new. <---> Among </---> other games like <+++> Spelunky </+++> <+++> Demon Souls </+++> and <+++> The Binding Of Isaac </+++> it showed that even if you weren't making a strict roguelike game there were still plenty of useful lessons to be learned from the genre structure. <+++> Crowntakers </+++> [$3. 99] from Kasedo Games presents another interesting twist on the formula bringing in elements from strategy <---> RPGs </---> to give the game some extra texture. It proves to be a winning combination. <---> The </---> king has been imprisoned by an evil duke .
