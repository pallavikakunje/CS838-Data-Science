Like everyone I have my own set of personal biases and preferences that I have to work around. I love RPGs but after years of social games and broken hearts I've come to flinch when I hear anything about a card battle system. I like card games well enough but when they're used as an RPG concept they tend to overtake the whole game. That not to say I've never enjoyed an RPG with a card-based battle system. The <+++> Baten Kaitos </+++> games on the <---> Gamecube </---> were pretty good and I certainly enjoyed the somewhat recent <+++> Card City Nights </+++> [$0. 99] from Ludosity. <---> But </---> I'm not going to lie it dampens my enthusiasm for a game just a little bit when I hear that cards are a major component. <---> Because </---> of that even though <+++> Trulon </+++> [$4. 99] was coming from a developer whose work I've greatly enjoyed in the past I was still a bit hesitant as I loaded it up. <+++> Trulon </+++> comes from Dicework Games the developer behind the wonderful <+++> Rimelands: Hammer Of Thor </+++> [$4. 99]. <---> In </---> some ways it quite the conventional RPG. There an overworld map where random encounters can occur dungeons and towns to explore and side-quests to solve. <---> Battles </---> are turn-based and you'll eventually have a full party of characters at your disposal. Winning fights earns you experience points towards gaining levels that will power up each character. <---> In </---> other ways it quite different. Hit points are restored at the end of each battle but magic points aren't. <---> Each </---> character draws their attacks from a selection of cards which are only refreshed when the battle is finished. Rather than equipping gear to each of them you'll instead equip passive abilities some of which are on all .
